            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is a double way of edification now in uſe in the Church of God, either by <hi>long Tracts,</hi> or by <hi>ſhort</hi> and <hi>pithy diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:</hi> Tis not for us to determine which is moſt profitable: <hi>Treatiſes</hi> have their uſe, &amp; ſo have <hi>ſingle Sermons:</hi> ſometimes tis good to ſee truths, not by <hi>piece</hi>-meal, but in their <hi>depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance</hi> and <hi>frame,</hi> that the whole Doctrine may be brought together, and digeſted into a method: On the other ſide, to ſay all that may be ſaid in an argument, is a <hi>burden</hi> and a <hi>prejudice</hi> to the common ſort of hearers, who when they find one point ſo much dilated and inſiſted upon, think that the knowledge of divine truths will be ſo long and tedious a work, that in a deſpair of attaining thereunto, they ſit down with any ſlight apprehenſions in the things of God, and ſuch thoughts as rather <hi>come upon them,</hi> then are <hi>found</hi> and <hi>ſearched</hi> out by them. It concerneth the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpel then, to uſe all methods to gain ſouls to God: Sometimes to launch out into the <hi>common-place,</hi> and <hi>larger diſcuſſion</hi> of truths, that they may at once ſee the whole latitude and breadth of them in one <hi>intire draught</hi> and <hi>delineation;</hi> at other times to conſine themſelves to the <hi>expreſs ſcope</hi> of that particular place which they have in hand, that the point and branch of Doctrine proper thereunto may be more earneſtly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly inforced: In the firſt method we may diſcern both the <hi>harmony</hi> and <hi>rich</hi>

               <hi>fulneſs</hi> of Scripture, whileſt we ſee how much God hath ſpoken in a little; and
<pb facs="tcp:115739:3"/> how a few words <hi>of His,</hi> (like a ſmall piece of gold) may without any forcing and violence, be beaten out into ſo large an explication: in the other method, truths many times come in <hi>freſher</hi> and <hi>ſweeter</hi> upon the ſoul, as being drawn more immediately from the fountain, and without the intervention of <hi>our Logick</hi> and <hi>diſcourſe,</hi> eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing their deduction to the conſciences of men.</p>
            <p>In both theſe methods, did that worthy ſervant of the Lord <hi>Mr. Strong</hi> excell: In a <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> who more <hi>copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> and <hi>full?</hi> In <hi>ſhorter diſcourſes,</hi> who more <hi>quick</hi> and <hi>ſinewy?</hi> Of his excellency in the former kind, the world hath had a taſte in what of his hath been already divulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, more of which kind alſo is intended for the Preſs: now thou haſt preſented to thy view, a collection of ſeveral choice Sermons upon ſpecial occaſions, ſome more <hi>publique,</hi> others more <hi>private,</hi> and therefore though in that reſpect there may be ſome difference between them in <hi>beauty</hi> and <hi>freſhneſs of colour,</hi> yet they all have the <hi>character</hi> and <hi>impreſs</hi> of <hi>Mr. Strongs</hi> ſpirit in them, and do plainly diſcover what hand hath paſſed upon them: the <hi>exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſefulneſs</hi> of the particular ſubjects, and that <hi>piety</hi> and <hi>judgement</hi> that ſhines forth in the management of them, cannot but recommend them to the reſpects of the godly wiſe, and therefore without any longer detaining thee, (only to aſſure thee that theſe are from his own notes) <hi>we commend thee to God, and the word of his grace, which is able to build us up, and give us an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance among them that are ſanctified.</hi>

Which though it ſhall begin in the days of thoſe Kings, in the times of the Roman Monarchies; yet it ſhall be the great Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the hand of God to deſtroy the Monarchies: for <hi>Iacob is in the hand of the Lord as a threſhing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument in the middle of the Nations;</hi> either <hi>as dew from the Lord;</hi> or <hi>as a Lyon amongſt the Beaſts of the Foreſt; the Angels they poured out the ſeven vials full of the wrath of God, which are the ſeven laſt plagues, they came out of the Temple,</hi> Rev. 15.6.

               <p>Its true that the Church of Chriſt hath a mighty efficacy upon the world, but it is ſecret, inviſible, and <hi>comes not under humane obſervation.

               </p>
               <p>But there will come a time when the power and glory of the Church ſhall be viſible; <hi>The mountain of the Lords houſe ſhall be exalted on the top of the mountains:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Lactantius.</note> when the propheſie of <hi>Lactan.</hi> p. 579. ſhall be fulfilled, <hi>Confundetur omne jus, &amp; leges interibunt: non fides in hominibus, non pax, non pudor; neque ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitas, neque Regimen; &amp; hujus confuſionis haec erit cauſa, quod Romanum nomen quo nunc regitur orbis, de terr a tolletur:</hi> And it is the duty of the people of God to eye the propheſies, and to look out for their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment; for <hi>the day of the Lord draws nigh; then ſhall the Lord be King over all the Earth, and Iehovah
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115739:18"/> ſhall be one, and his name one,</hi> Zach. 14.9. The moſt glorious and perfect propheſie of this Kingdom of God, which <hi>he ſhall ſet up</hi> in the latter days, we have, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.22. So in the laſt eight chapters of <hi>Ezekiel;</hi> which that I may give you a little light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, There are three things mainly to be explained: Firſt, what is meant by the <hi>City and Temple,</hi> here ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of? 2. Unto what time this propheſie doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long? 3. What the <hi>waters</hi> are <hi>which iſſue out of the ſanctuary?</hi> which being explained, will be as a key to open all the reſt of the myſteries that are therein contained.</p>
               <p>Firſt, unto what time is this propheſie to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred? for its a great part of a Saints skill to be able rightly <hi>to diſcern and judge of times,</hi> that they may know what to pray for, and what to expect, and when to co-operate and <hi>work together with God:</hi> Now the times to which this propheſie relates, are the times of the calling of the Jews, when <hi>their coming in ſhall be as life from the dead;</hi> and a new Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the world, which will appear to us by four Arguments.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it ſhall be after the Jews ſhall be converted; for it is ſaid, <hi>The houſe of Iſrael, ſhall defile my holy name no more as they have done by their abominations, ſetting their threſhold by my threſhold, and their poſt by my poſt: and by this means there was a wall of ſeparation between me and them, and in my anger I conſum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d them,</hi> chap. 43.7,8,9.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It ſhall be after the Tribes ſhall be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. <hi>After the ſticks of Ioſeph and of Iudah ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one in the Lords hand,</hi> Ezek. 37.19,20,23. And therefore the Land is now divided amongſt all the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115739:19"/> twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Chapter 48.</p>
               <p>3. It ſhall be after the glory of the Lord is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned; for <hi>the name of the City ſhall be Jehovah Sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mah, the Lord is there,</hi> chap. 48. ult. and he ſaith, <hi>I will dwell in the midſt of them for ever,</hi> chap. 43.9. <hi>I will ſet my ſanctuary in the middle of them for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> chap. 37.26. For when he doth return in to them again, he will never forſake them; <hi>he did</hi> indeed <hi>hide his face in a little wrath, and for a moment; but with everlaſting kindneſs he will have mercy on them,</hi> Iſa. 44.8. Ezck. 39.29. <hi>Neither will I hide my face any more from them, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. It ſhall be before <hi>Gog</hi> ſhall be deſtroyed; for <hi>he ſhall come up againſt the people of Iſrael when they are planted in their own land, and when they dwell ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> chap. 38.14,15. <hi>Then he ſhall come againſt them as a cloud, and cover the land, and the Lord ſhall give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gog a place of graves in Iſrael, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael muſt be planted firſt in their own land, and dwell there ſafely: therefore I conceive it to be the ſame time with that <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.22. when <hi>Jeruſalem ſhall come down from God out of heaven;</hi> and when <hi>the glory of the Lord ſhall be in the middle of them: the Tabernacle of God ſhall be with men, and he will dwell with them:</hi> And after they are ſetled in their own land, and the people of God have reſt for a thouſand years, <hi>then ſhall Satan be looſed,</hi> who before was not bound from temptation, but from perſecution; that he could not ſtir up men to perſecute the Saints; but as ſoon as he is looſed he ſtirs up this laſt and great enemy, and he doth compaſs the Tents of the Saints, and <hi>this holy City;</hi> and then the Lord ſhews himſelf eminent and glorious in his deſtruction: So that after Antichriſt
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115739:19"/> ſhall be deſtroyed, Satan ſhall be bound, ſo that the perſecution of the Saints ſhall ceaſe; then ſhall this City and Temple be built, which ſhall continue till the ſecond coming of the Lord, <hi>till the Heavens be no more:</hi> the time therefore is to come; do you long for it, and pray for it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, What is meant by the <hi>City</hi> and the <hi>Temple</hi> propheſied of Here? firſt, it cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood literally of a material City or Temple. <note place="margin">Peter Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus.</note> 
                  <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Galatinus</hi> tels us, that the Jews do commonly ſpeak of a threefold Temple. Firſt <hi>the Temple of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon.</hi> 2. <hi>The Temple of Zerubbabel.</hi> 3. The Temple of <hi>Jacob,</hi> which they ſay God ſhewed unto <hi>Iacob</hi> when he had the viſion of the Ladder. Now it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſpoken of the Temple of <hi>Solomon;</hi> for that was deſtroyed before the captivity, and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this propheſie was revealed, that was burnt with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>But if all places where the waters come are not healed, the Truths of God have not the ſame power and effect upon all; there are ſome myrie and mariſh places; Firſt, what is meant by theſe myrie and mariſh places? the word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> ſignifies a <hi>ditch, lacuna,</hi> a ſink, or a pit for dirty and foul water, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30,14. <hi>There is not a ſheard to take water out of the pit:</hi> and the reſemblance between men that live under Ordinances unfruitfully, and mariſh and myrie places, is very plain in three things. Firſt, in a mariſh place the water hath not a free paſſage, but it ſtands,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115739:22"/> and ſetles there: it hath not <hi>affluxus</hi> and <hi>reſuxus,</hi> it meets with many a ſtop, and a dam: ſo it is with ſuch a ſoul alſo: therefore the Apoſtle prays, that <hi>the Goſpel may run and be glorified,</hi> 2 Theſ. 3.1. Now when is the word ſaid to run? Firſt, when it meets with no ſtop, no oppoſition, but it hath a free paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, <hi>Cum libere propagatur:</hi> Secondly, when it goes through the whole man, and the will of God commanded is ſubjected unto, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 47.15. when the word runs very ſwiftly, that is, <note place="margin">Glaſſ.</note> 
                  <hi>Cum voluntas Dei per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agitur, &amp;c.</hi> Glaſſ.</p>
               <p>So that when it hath no ſtop either in the mouth of the Miniſters, or in the hearts of the Hearers, then the word is ſaid <hi>to run and be glorified:</hi> but when there are ſome truths of God that men cannot receive, the heart makes up a ſtop, a dam againſt them, they paſs not through the whole man, <hi>to bring into ſubjection every thought,</hi> 2 Cor. 10.6. but men <hi>impriſon truth in unrighteonſneſs, Rom.</hi> 1.18. and will not ſuffer it to paſs through the whole man, through the whole ſoul, this is <hi>a mariſh place, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, when the waters and the earth do mix together; this makes the myre; when the Truths of God do mix with the corruptions of men; that either men can hold ſome Truths, and yet keep their luſts: they can ſtand for truths, and yet they live in their ſins; and ſo ſhine as lights, and have their lamps, and yet be unclean all the while; or elſe when men do make uſe of the Truths of God to juſtifie their ſins, and they do plead the word of God to maintain their luſts; they can ſtand for the Truths of God, yet will not leave their luſts, but ſeek to cover them under it, <note place="margin">Clem.

                  <p>Secondly, there are no Judgements of God like unto ſpiritual Judgements: thoſe are of all other the moſt dreadfull, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 13. <hi>Why ſhould you be ſmitten any more? ye will revolt more and more.</hi> Hoſ. 4.14. <hi>I will not puniſh your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your Spouſes when they commit adultery,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>Firſt, becauſe every ſpiritual Judgement is in it ſelf a ſin; it is a judgement as from God, but in us
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115739:25"/> they are ſins alſo: now as there is not a worſe evil then ſin, for ſin is the greateſt evil, ſo it cannot be puniſhed with any thing worſe then it ſelf: the Apoſtle cannot call it by a worſe name then it ſelf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.7. <hi>ſinful ſin;</hi> and God cannot inflict a greater puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then it ſelf; and therefore after this life though the demerit of ſin ſhall ceaſe, the obligation of the Law ceaſing, as binding unto further puniſhment, when a man is actually under the ſentence of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; yet there is an obligation to the precept of the Law ſtill: for thou art bound to the precept as thou art a creature, and to the curſe only as thou art a ſinner; now the nature of ſin ſhall remain, though the demerit of ſin hath an end after this life, and yet in Hell, <hi>pertinet ad damnationis poenam:</hi> As all holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and obedience in heaven, <hi>pertinet ad beatitudinis praemium.</hi> The one is a part of a mans torment, as the other is part of a mans reward.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, becauſe of the ſubject on which it lights, is the ſoul; the ſoul is far more precious then the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and as any mercy to the ſoul is far beyond any bleſſing unto the body; ſo if <hi>the ſoul proſper, and the inward man be renewed,</hi> it is no great matter what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the outward man: though there be <hi>crus in nervo, ſi animus in coelo:</hi> for it is in the ſoul that the Lord dwells, and in the excellency of the ſoul that he doth delight: therefore <hi>let the hidden man of the heart be adorned:</hi> there is no adorning like it. <note place="margin">Tertul. Bernard.</note> 
                     <hi>Aliter pigmentatae ſunt veſtes: Indutus purpura, cum conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia pannoſa.</hi> And if the beauty of the inward man be ſo glorious, then there is no defilement like to that of the inward man, nor no puniſhment I ke to that upon the ſoul: as the Schoolmen ſay of Spiritual

                     <hi>Eleemoſyna cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis major quam corporis; ſpirituales Elcemoſynae ſunt corporalibus ſimpliciter praeferendae:</hi> So may we ſay of Spiritual Judgements; there are no judgements of God ſo much to be feared as Spiritual Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; as there are no mercies ſo much to be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as ſpiritual mercies: the proſperity of the ſoul ſhould be unto a Saint the meaſure of all proſperity; and the miſery of the ſoul and judgements upon it, ſhould be the meaſure of all miſeries and Judgements whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Spiritual Judgements are an argument of the greateſt wrath and diſpleaſure of God: its true its a judgement that God doth ſometimes inflict upon his own people, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.17. <hi>Why haſt thou cauſed us to erre from thy ways, and hardened our hearts from thy fear?</hi> but yet it is a greater teſtimony of his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, then God doth ſhew towards the men of his good will; there is no ſuch evidence of his wrath in the world, as this is; and ſo it is to wicked men alſo; for God <hi>to give them up unto their own hearts luſt,</hi> and <hi>to deliver them to Satan,</hi> as we ſee Chriſt did <hi>Judas:</hi>

In the afflictions of his people, <hi>Emendationi inſtat Deus.</hi> It is to reſtrain us, and reclaim us, &amp;c. But in ſpiritual Judgements the Lord doth give a man up to ſin, and leave him in the power of ſin, and under the dominion of ſin, as if he did never intend to do him good more.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, its the ſaddeſt evidence of a mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, and a moſt dreadfull earneſt of a mans damnation.</p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:115739:26"/>
                  <p>Firſt, its a ſad evidence of a mans reprobation; for there are three conſequents of reprobation, and both of them are ſpiritual Judgements.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Permiſsio peccati:</hi> the permiſſion of ſin.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>In peccato derelictio:</hi> the being left in ſin.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Traditio Satanae,</hi> to leave a man in the power of Satan, to give him over unto Satan, <hi>to carry him ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptive at his will;</hi> and all theſe are ſpiritual Judgements, <hi>Rev</hi> 13.8. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.8.</p>
                  <p>How came men to be inſnared with the Doctrine of Popery? and carried away with <hi>that doctrine of devils?</hi> they were given up in Judgement to it, as an evidence of their reprobation; for <hi>they worſhipped the Beaſt, and received his mark and his image, whoſe names are not written in the Lambs book of life,</hi> &amp;c. for as Spiritual bleſsings are pledges of election, ſo ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Judgements are dangerous ſigns of a mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they are a fearful earneſt of a mans damnation, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.12. <hi>He gave them up to believe that lye, that all they might be damned, who believed not the truth, but had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs,</hi> Heb. 10.27.

                     </gap>, <hi>A receiving of a ſentence,</hi> an eternal judgement in a mans own ſoul; when a man carries in his own heart the ſentence of his own condemnation; and there is not a greater earneſt of it in the world, then for a man to be given over by God unto ſpiritual Judgements: for that is the portion that all the Heirs of Hell have from the Lord; and as by the works of the ſpirit of adoption upon the ſoul, there is <hi>an earneſt</hi> of Heaven; ſo by the work of the Spirit of Bondage on the ſoul in judgement, there is an earneſt of Hell: the approaches
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115739:26"/> of God are in the one, and the deſertions of God are in the other.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, conſider what a great evil it is to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up unto this judgement of a perpetual barrenneſs: the ſins againſt the Goſpel muſt be eſpecially requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſuch judgements; for the Lord will have the judgement hold a proportion unto the ſin; now the more ſpiritual ſins are, and the more ſpiritual Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances are, the more ſpiritual muſt the judgement needs be: now as there are no ſins, nor no Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſo ſpiritual as thoſe under the Goſpel, ſo there are no judgements that are ſo ſpiritual: and therefore, as <hi>God is a ſpirit,</hi> and hates ſpiritual ſins moſt, ſo it is moſt agreeable unto him, the ſoul being a ſpirit, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the main hand in the ſin, to load that with ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual judgements.</p>
                  <p>But why will the Lord puniſh the neglect of the Goſpel with a perpetual Barrenneſs? <hi>Why ſhall the mariſh places be given to ſalt?</hi> The grounds are theſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, conſider of all Spiritual Judgements this is the greateſt; of all judgements the greateſt are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual judgements; and of all ſpiritual judgements, to be given up to barrenneſs is the greateſt: for it is that unto which all other Judgements tend, and in which they all end and center. There are many other ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Judgements, as there is a <hi>Judicial blindneſs</hi> and <hi>hardneſs of heart,</hi> a <hi>ſeared conſcience,</hi> a <hi>reprobate ſenſe;</hi> but what is all this for? it is that we might <hi>bring forth no fruit to God;</hi> and that nothing that is good might grow thereupon; and therefore it is that the <hi>Devil doth catch away the good ſeed,</hi> Matth. 13.19. <hi>That we might be as the high-way ground,</hi> unfruitful: we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:115739:27"/> of a barren earth by reaſon of the curſe, <hi>Curſed be the ground for thy ſake; when thou tilleſt it, it ſhall not yield thee fruit;</hi> but there are three ſorts of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Barrenneſſes, which are far beyond this, and are the fruits of a far greater curſe; and they are barren Churches, barren Ordinances, and barren hearts; there was never a more terrible monument of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral wrath, then the Lord ſhewed upon <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merrah, and thoſe Cities of the plain which are now turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the ſalt ſea, and their ſmoak aſcends continually, where nothing lives, where nothing grows, neither fruit nor graſs,</hi> Deut. 29.23. and therefore called the dead Sea, as <hi>Jerom</hi> ſaith, <note place="margin">Ierome.</note>

Now take an unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate man a barren ſoul, and he is compared here un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the dead ſea: for it is ſaid that fiſhers ſhall ſtand from <hi>Engedi</hi> to <hi>Eneglaim: Eneglaim in principio eſt maris mortui, ubi Iordanum ingreditur: Engedive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro, ubi finitur, atque conſumitur:</hi> As great, yea a far greater monument of Judgement, God gives unto a barren heart, then is that of the dead ſea: which is nothing elſe but a barren land, and barren waters, as they bring forth nothing that is good of themſelves: ſo neither is there any thing that can live or thrive or grow in them: but if it come into it, it immediatly dies: and ſo it is with any thing of God or the Spirit of God that comes into the barren heart, it is like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the dead ſea; what truths or motions ſoever are caſt in, they die immedi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tly.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This is the greateſt judgement, becauſe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:115739:27"/> hereby thou loſeſt the fruit of thy union with Chriſt, and the comfort of it: for the end of union with Chriſt is fruitfulneſs; and it is a plain argument that he that brings forth no fruits to God, was never mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried unto Chriſt: for <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.4. <hi>We are ſaid to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried unto Chriſt, that we may bring forth fruit to God:</hi> There is a double end of Marriage, <hi>convictus &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les:</hi> Cohabitation and propagation; and therefore there cannot be a greater evidence that thou art not yet married unto Chriſt, then this, thou art barren; for the Spouſe of Chriſt is fruitfull, and he hath no further a delight in them then as they bring forth fruit; for it was the very end of his coming, <hi>That they might bring forth fruit, and that more abundantly, and that their fruit might remain.</hi> Now to be much in fruitfulneſs, <hi>to be rich in good works,</hi> is a great mercy. <hi>Si mihi daretur eptio, eligerem unius Chriſtiani ruſtici opus ſordidiſsimum, prae omnibus victoriis &amp; triumphis Alexandri Caeſaris,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Quando fidelis es, Deo placent etiam Phyſica, corporalia, &amp; animalia officia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And how great a comfort is it, <hi>to bring forth fruit to God?</hi> becauſe it is <hi>fruit abounding unto our accounts,</hi> at the laſt and the great day; now as fruitfulneſs is a certain evidence of our marriage to Chriſt: ſo bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs is a certain evidence that thou art not yet married unto Chriſt: and to be given up in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to barrenneſs, is an earneſt thou ſhalt never be married to him; and fruitfulneſs is an argument and a pledge unto a mans heart that Chriſt will delight in him, as <hi>Leah</hi> ſaid, when ſhe had born a ſon, <hi>Now my husband will love me; now he will be joyned to me, now I have born him this ſon alſo.</hi> So may a ſoul reaſon it out with Chriſt: Now I ſhal have his love, he wil love me,

                     </gap>ow I have yielded him fruit; for <hi>he doth delight in the fruits of his pleaſant things,</hi> Cant. 5.12.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, there is nothing that ſtands between ſuch a ſoul and wrath: for <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.2. <hi>Every branch in me that bears no fruit, my father takes away,</hi> that is, he is caſt out of the vine, of which he did ſeem to be a branch: <hi>and he withers,</hi> and is thereby prepared for to be fuel for the fire: its true, if there were the leaſt fruit, or the leaſt hope and expectation of it, it would be reprieved: for, if there be <hi>but a cluſter, Iſa.</hi> 65 8. the Lord ſaith, <hi>ſpare it, for there is a bleſsing in it:</hi> but when Chriſt comes to expect fruit, and findeth nothing but leaves, no fruits thereon, then there is a curſe neer, <hi>Never fruit grow on thee henceforth for ever.</hi> And by ſuch a curſe the man withers at the root immediatly. <hi>Chryſoſt. de poenit.</hi> doth allude to the manner of men. <note place="margin">Chryſoſt.</note> 
                     <hi>Romanae leges poenam praeg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanti deferunt:</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, If the Laws of men ſpare for the fruits ſake, how much more will the goodneſs and the mercy of God do it, if there be <hi>but a cluſter?</hi> but where there is no fruit, there is nothing now between that and the fire: there is nothing ſo much as to defer the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>There is a double curſe upon a barren tree: not only the original curſe which is the ground and cauſe of barrenneſs: but there is a particular curſe, when the Lord pronounceth a ſentence of perpetual barrenneſs to this very end, that the ſoul being cut off may <hi>wither,</hi> and may thereby be prepared for the fire: and it is ſaid, they are withered, and men gather them: they are caſt into the fire, and they burn:
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:115739:28"/> the fire of Hell burns ſo fiercely upon none as upon them that are caſt out as withered branches in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for their unfruitfulneſs.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, why will the Lord give men over to a perpetual barrenneſs, that they ſhall never more bear fruit, but as it is ſaid, <hi>Iude</hi> 12. <hi>They are without fruit, twice dead, and pluckt up by the roots:</hi> as there is no fruit for the preſent, ſo there is no hope of fruit for the future: for the Tree <hi>is pluckt up by the roots;</hi> theſe are men given up to perpetual <hi>barrenneſs;</hi> and the grounds of it are ſuch as theſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, if any thing would make them fruitful, the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel would: for we ſee that if <hi>the waters that iſſue out of the ſanctuary,</hi> run out into the dead ſea, the waters ſhall not be healed: and that there is as little hope of fruit from ſuch, as there is of the dead Sea, that it ſhould be yet fruitful, and therefore <hi>Zach</hi> 14.8. <hi>Living waters ſhall go out from Ieruſalem towards the firſt ſea:</hi> this <hi>mare primum</hi> is nothing elſe but <hi>mare mortuum,</hi> or the dead ſea: and why are they called living waters? not only <hi>formaliter,</hi> or as they are <hi>aquae perennes,</hi> ſuch as do always flow; but <hi>effective,</hi> becauſe they do beget life where they come: and <hi>all things where the waters come do live;</hi> and there are <hi>trees for fruit on every ſide,</hi> becauſe the waters do come thither: yea, even when there was as little hope either of life, or fruit as there it now in reſpect of the dead ſea.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there is no other uſe to be made of them: they muſt be either for fruit, or elſe for fuel: for men that live unprofitably under the Ordinances, are good for nothing: as it is with a vine, if it be not fruitfull, it is uſefull for nothing elſe in the world: for <hi>a man cannot take a pin from it,</hi> Ezek. 15.3. thoſe that are
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:115739:29"/> branches in the vine: fruitfulneſs doth prepare it for pruning and ſoiling: <hi>for every branch in me that bears fruit, the father purgeth that it may bring forth more fruit:</hi> ſo barrennes &amp; unfruitfulnes doth prepare it for lopping, that it be cut down, that it may be profitable one way; for all the garden of Paradiſe the Lord hath reſerved for one of theſe ends: ſome of them, becauſe he would not have them all periſh, he hath reſerved for fruit; and ſome when he hath a long time expected fruit, and <hi>indured with much long pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and ſuffering the veſſels of wrath, prepared for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>on,</hi> now he cuts them down, and lays them up for fuel; for <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.4. <hi>he made all things for himſelf;</hi> and he will make ſome advantage of all the creatures to his own glory; they ſhall be ſome way or other ſerviceable, either as <hi>veſſels of mercy,</hi> or <hi>as veſſels of wrath,</hi> either to honor or to diſhonor.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Lord doth this becauſe therein are ſeveral provocations, that they are unto him.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he hath beſtowed much labour upon them: for <hi>the father is the husband-man;</hi> and his eye is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference unto fruit, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49 45. <hi>I have laboured in vain, and ſpent my ſtrength in vain:</hi> When he hath dunged and digged about it, not only the barrenneſs, but the loſs of his labour then is a provocation: then the Lord lays a man out of his hand: <note place="margin">Ier. 6.29.</note> 
                     <hi>Then reprobate ſilver ſhall men call them, when the Lord hath rejected them: I would have formed you, I would have purged you, but now you ſhall never be formed or purged.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Lord expects fruit, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. <hi>I looked for grapes:</hi> for though nothing is hid from God, yet he ſpeaks after the manner of men, through his patience, and long ſuffering, waiting upon them, that never
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:115739:29"/> bring forth fruit; now it is a dangerous provocation to deceive his expectation, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.12. <hi>I looked for mourning, but there was rejoycing with the harps, &amp;c. This iniquity ſhall not be purged from you till you die.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they diſhonor the Lords vineyard, that there ſhould be found fruitleſs trees; and therefore the Lord is provoked againſt them to take them away, which he doth by giving them up to perpetual bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs: this Judgement is that which the Saints fear and bewail, as <hi>Beza</hi> ſaith, <note place="margin">Beza.</note>

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:115739:36"/> glory hereafter; here there are great ſhews of holineſs and ſhadows which are not ſo, that men do count holineſs; and many are cryed up for Saints in their generation: or (as is the foolery of this age) becauſe other men will not, they will canonize themſelves for Saints: but there is a <hi>holineſs</hi> of <hi>truth</hi> that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. and ſuch a holineſs it muſt be, not in name only, but in truth, not in word, but in power; and it is obſervable that the Apoſtle here makes it excluſive, but only to the laſt particle; he exhorts you to follow peace and holineſs, but he adds <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>, without which there may be a ſeeing of God without peace (that is) a man may follow peace and not attain it, and yet ſee God, but without holineſs none can ſee him; it is commonly by Interpreters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained unto the viſion of God in glory, and therefore ſo I ſhall conſider it only at this time, and the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation that it doth give us, is this:</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Holineſs is the only way to happineſs: there is no ſeeing</hi> of God in glory without it; <hi>none ſhall ſee God but the holy man:</hi> And here for the right underſtanding of it, we are to conſider holineſs three waies.</p>
                  <p>Firſt <hi>quoad principium,</hi> according unto the principle of it, and that is <hi>Regeneration,</hi> when the ſeeds of holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (that is) holy principles are ſown, a new image is begun:</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>quoad incrementum,</hi> according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of it: which is <hi>ſanctification,</hi> by which he that is new born to God grows up to the perfection of thoſe habits received in the fear of God:</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>quoad exercitium,</hi> for the putting forth of thoſe inward improved principles in a way of holy walking: and this is in Scripture called <hi>obedience:</hi>

                  <p>Firſt Holineſs <hi>quoad principium,</hi> which is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called <hi>regeneration,</hi> and without this there is no ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, <hi>John</hi> 3.3. <hi>Jeſus ſaid, verily verily,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>except a man be born again, he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God;</hi> we have firſt the manner of the aſſertion: firſt, <hi>nota di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnitatis,</hi> there is no truth but is a beam from the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of light; but there are ſome truths more <hi>preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> and of greater worth then others. Secondly, <hi>not a certitudinis,</hi> all his words are true, yet he doth ſet a ſpecial impreſs of truth for to be obſerved upon ſome words more then upon others:</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the thing aſſerted, except a man be born from above, <hi>non unius partis correctionem, ſed totius na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae renovationem deſignat.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the univerſality of the aſſertion, <hi>aequiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let univerſali:</hi> what age, or calling, or condition ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, though this man were one that lived in the Church, a Phariſee, civil in his Converſation, a Saint in his generation, he was a man that had attained a more then ordinary pitch of knowledge, a teacher, and of a good diſpoſition, a man not bitter againſt
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:115739:37"/> Chriſt, as the reſt of his ſect were, and yet Chriſt ſaith to him, he muſt be born again: a man may be a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of a Church, of a loving and ingenuous diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a fair and unblamable converſation, and a man of that eminency in knowledge that he may be a teacher of others, and yet this man muſt be born again, <hi>or he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the neceſſity he puts upon it alſo; the Kingdom of God is both the Kingdom of grace here, and hereafter of glory; and to ſee it, is <hi>frui</hi> to enjoy it, <hi>participem fieri,</hi> as <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>he cannot enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdom of God;</hi> ſo that to ſee it, is to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, or to have a mans own part and portion in it, with the reſt of the Saints; ſo that let a man be never ſo great in the world, never ſo eminent for profeſſion, let his outward carriage be never ſo upright, nay, Angelical, yet if he hath no birth but his firſt birth, he is not in Gods account a member of this Kingdom of grace, nor hath any right to the priviledges of it here, or of the Kingdom of glory hereafter: <hi>he hath no part or portion therein.</hi> There are two parables by which Chriſt doth hold this forth to us clearly: firſt that of the <hi>marriage of the Kings ſon, Matth.</hi> 22. there is <hi>a gueſt that comes without a wedding garment,</hi> it is not a ſleight thing to come to the ordinances in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel in an unregenerate ſtate; if there be but one, the King will come in to ſee the gueſts; this wedding garment is—Chriſt put on by faith, in a work of vocation: and the image of Chriſt begins in a man in the work of regeneration: and he ſhall be caſt out from the wedding, that is ſo in the day when the Lord ſhall come and viſit the gueſts: ſo that parable of <hi>the fooliſh Virgins.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Math. 25.</note> Firſt, Virgins they were, and kept
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:115739:37"/> their garments from groſs pollutions. Secondly, they were Profeſſors, and they joyned in ſociety wih the wiſe. Thirdly, in high eſteem they were, for they <hi>had oyl in their Lamps:</hi> they did <hi>ſhine as Lights in the world.</hi> Fourthly, they held out with great expectation unto the coming of the Lord, for <hi>they went out to meet the Bride;</hi> and yet <hi>they were ſhut out when the Bridegroom came:</hi> becauſe they had oyl in their Lamps, but none in their Veſſels: the gifts of the Spirit of God are of two ſorts, ſome <hi>qualifying,</hi> as the Spirit is <hi>forma aſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtens,</hi> and works upon them in acts; and this is oyl enough to cauſe them to make a profeſſion, and to ſhine as Lights in the world: but ſome are renewing, as the Spirit is <hi>forma informans, A ſpirit dwelling in the Saints, as a fountain of living Waters, ſpringing up to Everlaſting life.</hi> Now they that had the one without the other, were ſhut out with <hi>I know you not, &amp;c.</hi> And we have one famous inſtance in the Scripture, and that is of <hi>Timothy;</hi> he was born in the Church, of godly Parents, there was <hi>faith unfeigned</hi> in his grandmother <hi>Lois,</hi> &amp;c. he was one Religiouſly educated, for <hi>he knew the Scripture from a child,</hi> and he was a child of a great deal of forwardneſs, in ſo much that the People of God had great hopes of him; there were many Propheſies that foreſpake him, that he would be an eminent and a bleſſed inſtrument in the Church of God: <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>according to the Propheſie foreſpoken that went of thee:</hi> and yet for all this there had been no Salvation for <hi>Timothy,</hi> but that he was begotten by <hi>Paul</hi> through the Goſpel, <hi>He is my own ſon in the faith,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.2.</p>

                  <p>And the reaſons of it are two;</p>
                  <p>Firſt it is in Regeneration that a man receives a new and another ſpirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. <hi>We have not received the ſpirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God. My ſervant</hi> Caleb <hi>hath another ſpirit,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>Numb</hi> 14.24. There is a double ſpirit that acts all Mankind; all unregenerate men are under the power of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, who is the ſpirit of the world: the world lies <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.19. <note place="margin">
                        <hi>In aliquo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicum eſſe, eſt ſub ejus eſſe poteſtate.</hi> Camer.</note> And this ſpirit acts and effects works in all the <hi>children of diſobedience:</hi> yea even in the elect before their converſion: before their rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration <hi>the ſtrong man armed keeps the houſe, till a ſtronger then he comes:</hi> but when <hi>the time comes that is appointed by the Father, that the ſoul ſhall be</hi> actually <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto</hi> Chriſt, who was in his purpoſe and in his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant given to him before the world was, for <hi>there was grace given us in Chriſt before the world began,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Now he ſends forth the ſpirit of his ſon into their hearts,</hi> and he takes poſſeſſion of them for the Lord: and the ſtrong man that formerly kept the houſe, is caſt out: that he that was before the devils houſe, he is now <hi>the Temple of the Holy ghoſt,</hi> and <hi>the habitation of God through the ſpirit:</hi> now there are none for whom the houſe in heaven is prepared, but they that have been the habitation of God here: none ſhal dwell with God hereafter, in whom the Spirit did not dwell here: the ſame ſpirit, that as a ſpirit of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs dwels in them here, it is the ſame ſpirit that is in them as a ſpirit of adoption and glory hereafter: therefore the great change in a man, the firſt change as the firſt fruit of electing love, is in the receiving of <hi>another ſpirit,</hi> and that is only in regeneration: then
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:115739:38"/> 
                     <hi>is the ſpirit of Chriſt ſent forth into the hearts of the Saints.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, in regeneration a man receives a new Principle: for by nature a man hath not in him a Principle of communion with God, or of obedience to him, <hi>Ioh</hi> 3.6. that is Chriſts Reaſon, <hi>That which is born of the fleſh is fleſh:</hi> it is wholly corrupt, and that by which the ſoul is no way fitted to <hi>walk with God:</hi> therefore marvell not that I ſay unto you, that thou muſt be born again: grace is <hi>a new creature,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.10. <hi>We are created in Chriſt, to good works:</hi> it is <hi>a new man,</hi> an inward man: and it is from this created infuſed habit that all holy actions flow: let a mans duties be never ſo many, and his outward beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour be never ſo Saint like, if it doth not flow from a new man, an inward man, it can no ways pleaſe God, or be accepted of him: its a <hi>Law written in the heart,</hi> ſpiritually enlightning the underſtanding, and effectually determining the will unto Objects ſpiritual and ſupernaturally good: and before this be wrought in a man, there are no duties that are looked upon as duties by him. <hi>Behold he prays, Acts</hi> 9. ſaith the Lord to <hi>Ananias</hi> concerning <hi>Paul:</hi> he was a Phariſee, and they were much in prayer: but it was never looked upon and reckoned as a prayer by God, till he had a new principle, a new man: for the Lord looks to the heart; that is, he ſees actions in their principles: men can judge of principles only by their actions: but God doth judge of actions according to the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples from whence they flow. The <hi>tree muſt be good,</hi> or elſe to God the fruit can never be good, but as the apples of <hi>Sodom:</hi> they muſt be good things that muſt be brought forth from an inward Treaſury. And
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:115739:39"/> take a godly man that is converted, when he doth not <hi>ſtir up the grace of God that he hath received,</hi> &amp; acts it in duty, he doth perform it but barely as a natural man; and it doth not ſtand upon account before God as a duty; no further then there is an exerciſe of the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate part, is any ſervice accepted of God; for it is the <hi>good work that is begun in us,</hi> that <hi>the Lord will perfect, Phil.</hi> 1.6. therefore grace is a <hi>good work in us:</hi> a principle in the ſoul, fitting it for ſervice and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; and it is this that is ordained unto perfection in glory. If there be not a new principle, <hi>a good work begun,</hi> never look to have it perfected in <hi>the day of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſee I am much prevented; I ſhall but touch the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Let us look upon holineſs <hi>quoad incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum;</hi> and ſo its commonly called in Scripture <hi>Sanctification,</hi> that is, the growth and improvement of that ſeed, and thoſe principles that were wrought in a man at his firſt converſion, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3 18. <hi>Grow in grace.</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Add to your faith vertue; non quoad habitum, ſed actum &amp; gradum;</hi> add to the acts, and thereby add to the degrees of the habit; for acts do perfect habits: And <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12. it is not barely the having of grace, that is required unto Salvation, but it is the growth of it, and the improvement of it, that a man may be made meet for glory: I ſay, growth in grace is a duty, that is of neceſſity to Salvation as well as truth in grace, where God gives light and means; I ſpeak not now of Infants, or ſuch as dye as ſoon as they are converted, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12. <hi>We are made meet Inheriters with the Satuts in light.</hi> There is a double right that the Saints have to heaven.</p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:115739:39"/>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Jus haereditarium,</hi> an hereditary right, and that is at Regenration, when they are put into Chriſt, and ſo are made <hi>Coheirs</hi> with him of his inheritance, having <hi>grace begun</hi> in them, the ſame Image of God which ſhall be perfected in glory, and was given as a principle ordained to ſuch a perfection.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Jus aptitudinarium,</hi> and that is a right of fitneſs, whereby we are qualified to receive ſuch a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and that is as an heir hath a right of Inheritance in his nonage, but he hath not a right of fitneſs till he comes to years, and be able to manage his Eſtate, when he hath received it: And there is required in the Saints as well a right of fitneſs unto Heaven, as a right of inheritance, without which, I may ſay (after a ſort) they cannot be ſaved, and that upon a double ground.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, there is no grace that is ordained unto glory, but growing grace; and if grace be true, there is a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural tendency in it unto growth: as there is in ſeed that is caſt into the earth; and ſo much the more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>they are planted by the rivers of water: the Trees of righteouſneſs they grow upon the bank of the River,</hi> Ezek. 47.10. <hi>They ſhall grow as Willows, they ſhall grow as Calves of the ſtall,</hi> Mal. 4.2. There is a great meaſure of growth promiſed unto them: and if true grace be neceſſary to ſalvation, then growth of grace muſt be; for there is no true grace but growing grace, and there is no grace that ſhall come to Heaven elſe: <hi>I forget that which is behind, not that I have already attained:</hi> Grace is not only <hi>donum,</hi> but <hi>depoſitum,</hi> and it muſt be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved; it is a <hi>Talent</hi> that more muſt be gained by, by Trading, &amp;c. it is a ſpark from Heaven that will never ceaſe aſpiring till it be joyned with the flame of glory <hi>Eternal in the Heavens.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:115739:40"/>
                  <p>Secondly, there is a pitch of grace that the Lord hath appointed unto his People that they ſhall fill up whileſt they live here, before they be tranſlated unto glory: there is a <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, Epheſ. 4.13. <hi>A fulneſs of the age of the ſtature of Chriſt,</hi> a meaſure that Chriſt hath appointed unto them, and with which he will fill and enrich them that are the body of Chriſt, of which every member is a part, and which he by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of his grace doth fill up: which is in this reſpect as it were imperfect, till the meaſure of his Saints be filled, not only in ſuffering, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.24. but in graces alſo. Now the Lord having appointed them a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which they are all in this life to fulfill; as he will not deſtroy wicked men till they have fulfilled their meaſure; <hi>fill up</hi> (ſaith Chriſt to the Phariſees) <hi>the meaſure of your fathers iniquities:</hi> ſo neither will he tranſlate the Saints, till they have fulfilled their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which is done by ſome ſooner, and ſome later: and when the meaſure is full, as then <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. <hi>He doth tread the wine-preſs of his Fathers vengeance</hi> upon the wicked: So when <hi>the Corn is ripe, he doth put in his Sicle and reap, and gathers it into his barn,</hi> &amp;c. therefore Job 5.26. <hi>Thou ſhalt come to thy grave in a good full age, as a ſhock of Corn in his ſeaſon:</hi> God will not reap till his har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt be ripe; therefore the Lord hath appointed a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and what it is we know not; we ſhould ſet no bounds to our ſelves, but ſtrive unto the uttermoſt, adding one degree of grace unto another: ſo be ſure of this, till thou attain thy meaſure, thou ſhalt never be received unto glory; and therefore unto the actual poſſeſſion of grace, growth in grace is as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in ſome reſpects, as truth of grace is. What is the reaſon that a wicked man doth commit iniquity an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:115739:40"/> times, and his dayes are prolonged? it is becauſe he hath not filled up his meaſure, <hi>Joel</hi> 3.13,14. So, what is the reaſon that ſome of the Saints are taken up betimes into Heaven, and others of the People of God are a long time in the world? Why it is becauſe they have not fulfilled their meaſure; for the Lord would not ſtay a day beyond his time in the one as well as in the other: the one is ripe for wrath, and the other is made meet for glory.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, look upon Holineſs <hi>quoad exercitium,</hi> and ſo its called <hi>Obedience:</hi> and this alſo is neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; that unto men grown, ſtrong Chriſtians; without the exerciſe of Holineſs in wayes of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence they can never ſee the Lord: A man muſt <hi>run</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>he can receive the prize,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.24. <hi>And he muſt fight the good fight of faith, and finiſh his courſe, before he ſhall receive the Crown of righteouſneſs,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.8. <hi>To him that overcometh I will grant to ſit upon my Throne, as I overcame, and am ſat down with my Father upon his Throne, &amp;c.</hi> Rev. 3.21. Its called <hi>The Labourers are worthy of their hire:</hi> the hire is for the Labourers, and for none elſe; <hi>Opera non ſunt minus neceſſaria, quam ſides ipſa,</hi> Luther: Obedience and good works are in ſome ſenſe as neceſſary to Salvation as Faith; I ſay as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, though not in the ſame kind, as the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Juſtification.</p>
                  <p>And there is alſo a double ground for it:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe there is a meaſure of Obedience which the Lord hath appointed unto all the Saints before they ſhall be tranſlated; it ſhall not be <hi>till their Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is fulfilled,</hi> 2 Cor. 10.6. as men ſhall not take them away, <hi>The Witneſſes ſhall not be ſlain till they have finiſhed their teſtimony,</hi> Rev. 11. So God will not take

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:115739:42"/> of the Goſpel, is truly affected with the honor and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor of God: for <hi>holineſs exalts God.</hi> I ſay, <hi>holineſs exalts God;</hi> in <hi>Joſhua</hi> 7.9. <hi>Iſrael</hi> had fallen before the men of <hi>At</hi> their enemies; what is it now that troubles <hi>Joſhuah</hi> moſt? <hi>Iſrael flyes before their enemies; Lord, what wilt thou do for thy great name?</hi> truly, though we ſhould periſh, and our names be rooted out from under heaven, our names rot in the earth, it were no great matter; but thy name, Lord, ſaith he, I am not able to bear the thought of it, <hi>what wilt thou do to thy great name?</hi> ſo likewiſe <hi>David, The reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me;</hi> he could have born any thing better, then that God ſhould have been diſhonored; <hi>my cyes guſh out with Rivers of water, becauſe men keep not thy Law; malo in nos murmur hominum quam in Deum,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Bernard.</note> I remember it is <hi>Bernards</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; rather ſaith he, let men vent their diſpleaſure againſt us then againſt God: <hi>bonum eſt mihi ſi dignetur Deus me uti pro clypeo:</hi> if the Lord would pleaſe to make uſe of me to keep off reproaches, and injuries from himſelf, it would be ſatisfaction enough to me; let my name be blotted never ſo much, if Gods name be not ſpotted: if his name be not profaned, it is enough: Now if I ſhould put you to examine your hearts by this: Is Gods glory dear to you, and do you ſay, profaned be my name, ſo as Gods name be honored; is there nothing better to you in this world like to this? my conſcience anſwers in the preſence of God to ſuch a queſtion as this: Truly (my Brethren) I am afraid few of you can ſay in truth, that <hi>the Lord is thus exalted in your ſouls;</hi> how is it that the diſhonors done to God, either we make matter of ſcoff, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it doth but draw out our envies, and invectives,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:115739:42"/> but it is not matter of drooping continually upon our Spirits: there are few Ages that you ſhall read of, wherein the name of God hath been higher, in a more impudent way diſhonored, then in this Age, (I may ſay it with boldneſs) with more open face, a <hi>Whores forehead that cannot bluſh;</hi> and yet notwithſtanding, <hi>where be the morners in Sion?</hi> where be thoſe that do ſay, My eſtate doth me no good, and my honor doth me no good, nor never will while I enjoy it without God, while I ſee God diſhonored? Well, certainly, ſuitable to the meaſure of holineſs that is in any man, ſo will his affections be to the honor of God; and where this affection is not in truth, there is no holineſs in truth. This is the firſt thing.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond ſign that I ſhall give you to examine your ſelves by, is this. Where holineſs is in truth, there the heart is mightily affected unto the truth of God, which is the foundation of bolineſs; <hi>ſanctifie them by thy truth:</hi> it is the expreſſion in <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. then Truth is the foundation of ſanctification: whenſoever holineſs is in truth, then the man is mightily affected to truth: &amp; I do reu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:115739:43"/> of holineſs; and I ſay unto you, it will bear a child-like affection thereunto: my Brethren, will you give me leave a little to ſpeak plainly to you; the great deſign that Satan hath (I conceive) in this preſent age; the great deſign (for he hath many) but I ſay, the Great deſign, I look upon to be this: So to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute all things, as that in matters of Religion men might look upon nothing as certain: diſpute all things, that ſo you may be certain of nothing: for this hath been the great buſineſs: and truly I muſt (though ſome of them go under the name of Saints) I muſt ſay, they are highly the inſtruments of the Devil in it: I fay, the great buſineſs of theſe latter years hath been this, it hath been to diſpute principles, and overthrow foundations. <note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> 
                     <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, there are two waies by which the Devil draws men from Chriſt: one in a time of peace: and another in a time of perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: in a time of perſecution, <hi>coget homines negare Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum,</hi> he compels men to deny Chriſt, in the time of perſecution: But in the time of proſperity, <hi>docet,</hi> he teacheth men then to deny Chriſt, he finds out ſuch Doctrines as ſhall teach men handſomly to deny Chriſt, and to defend it when he hath done; O my Brethren, how doth this ſit upon your Spirits? It was <hi>Luthers</hi> ſaying, <note place="margin">Luther.</note> 
                     <hi>Spiritus ſanctus Scepticus non eſt,</hi> the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit is not a Sceptical Spirit, there is little of that Spirit in this Land; Chriſtianiſm is turned to Sceptiſm, queſtion every thing, and diſpute every thing; and men look upon it as a great piece of Religion, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that there is no certainty in Religion; and truly this is the way of the wiſe men of our times: Why, now conſider two things are added hereunto. One is to proſecute this deſign, the Miniſtry muſt firſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalued,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:115739:43"/> that by that means there may be way made that they may be ſuppreſſed; for while theſe men live, they do ſay in their own boſoms ſo much as <hi>Saul</hi> did of <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Ionathan, while the ſon of Ieſſe liveth,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>thy Kingdom will never be eſtabliſhed:</hi> they do ſay ſo, that theſe new waies of Religion will never be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, ſo long as ſome of theſe men continue: they do ſay, that this is the <hi>Heir, let us kill him,</hi> and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance will be ours; we ſhall never be the great Preachers till then; nor our lights, and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will never be entertained for Goſpel till then; for ſo what was the advice of <hi>Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> the Jeſuite a great while ago; and truly this is the very truth; for as it is juſtly to be feared you have a great many among you, ſo thoſe that are acted among you, are acted very much by a Jeſuitical principle; and what was his advice? he wiſheth them by all means to take away the Miniſtry; but ſaith, do it not all at once, but take away ſome firſt, and diſgrace the reſt: and ſo by that means a way will be mace that you may lay them aſide when you will; and he gives them his reaſon for it; take away thoſe that are able to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thoſe Doctrines once, and then the Doctrines will fall of themſelves: <hi>Haereſis</hi> (for ſo he cals the truth) <hi>cui patrocinium decrit, ſine pugnâ concidet:</hi> alas, take a poor upſtart fellow now, that looks upon himſelf as a great Preacher, <hi>underſtanding not what he ſaith,</hi> it is an eaſie matter to make this man leave this truth, or that truth; but take another man that is able to aſſert it: and alas, before ſuch a man theſe men dare not appear: and therefore I ſay, that theſe Doctrines they cry down will never fall, ſo long as they live to maintain them, therefore down with them.</p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:115739:44"/>
                  <p>Another way that is effectual to further this great deſign is this, which you cannot but ſee: who muſt be imbraced, countenanced: I wiſh it be not ſo with thoſe in authority here among you, I wiſh it be not ſo; who muſt be received as the men of their Councel, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained at their table, why, who muſt they be? truly, ſuch as do maintain ſome abominable Doctrine in matters of Religion: that by this means ſuch men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing countenanced by men in place and authority, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their ware may vent the better; that is the way I ſay, the ware may vent the better: and whereas, oh that the Lord would be pleaſed but to let men conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that in the 2 Ep. of <hi>Iohn</hi> v. 10. <hi>He that brings not this Doctrine, receive him not into your houſes, bid him not God ſpeed:</hi> have no converſe, no communion with him; there is not ſo much as common civility to be ſhewed to him; <hi>a ſtranger you are to take in,</hi> but <hi>an heretick you are not.</hi> Now I intreate you to conſider ſeriouſly with your ſelves; if truth be the mother of holineſs, and you ſee truth is ſo much in danger, and ſo much laid at, and the great deſigns of the times run this way, how are your hearts affected with it? Certainly, if thou haſt holineſs in truth, thou wilt be mightily affected with truth that is the mother of holineſs. This is a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Rule. There are two or three more; but I am very fearful of treſpaſſing upon you.</p>
                  <p>One is; where there is holineſs in truth, that man is affected with ſpiritual ſins: that man is moſt affected with ſpiritual ſins: you ſhall find the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Cleanſe your ſelves from all filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit:</hi> that is the aim of the holy man, the Godly man, in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. but the great thing that doth affect his ſoul, is ſpiritual ſins; that <hi>which no eye takes notice of,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:115739:44"/> but the eye of God only;</hi> ſo you ſhall find in <hi>Pſal</hi> 42.11. there the baſe dejection of ſpirit, how <hi>David</hi> is troubled at i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>; <hi>why art thou caſt down O my ſoul?</hi> ſo likewiſe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal confidence; in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80.7. he ſaith, <hi>I ſaidthon haſt made my mountain to ſtand ſtrong:</hi> grudging at the proſperity of the wicked; <hi>ſo fooliſh was I, and ignorant, I was as a Beaſt before thee:</hi> all my waies are bruitiſh; I am more brutiſh then any man. <hi>Paul the rebellion to the Law that was in his members. Hezekiah</hi> humbled himſelf for <hi>the pride of his heart:</hi> thus the people of God, they are more affected with ſpiritual ſins com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the eye of God, then they are in reference unto outward ſins committed before the eyes of men: they are more aſhamed before God, then they can be before men. Mr. <hi>Bradford,</hi> though he were a man had attained to a great meaſure of holineſs, that Doctor <hi>Taylor</hi> cals him, That Saint of God <hi>Iohn Bradford,</hi> yet how doth he bewail his hypocriſie!</p>
                  <p>Now do you examine your hearts by thi :if you be holy, you be not affected only with ſins before men, but that which ſitteth ſadlieſt upon your ſpirits, is, that your hearts are defiled before God: you are more aſhamed before him, then you are before all the men in the world. That is a third Rule, which I do but name.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, where there is holineſs in truth, there the man ſets before him as his mark, the moſt difficult du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in Religion: he doth not take up the eaſieſt dut ies; but I ſay, though he fall ſhort in performance many times, yet he ſets before him as a mark to aim at, the moſt difficult duties of Religion. <hi>I preſs hard to the mark,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul;</hi> a mark of an enlightned underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which I conceive as well as that goal of glory:
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:115739:45"/> now as there are in the cripture ſome things that are <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, hard to be underſtood, as the Apoſtle ſaith: ſo there are ſome duties too in Scripture that are <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, hard to be put in practiſe, very hard: now the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man, he hath an eye unto the moſt difficult duties in Religion; for he knows that all theſe lie upon him as duties, and he ſets them before him as a mark that he aims at; and I will name ſome of them to you, that I may draw to a concluſion.</p>
                  <p>As firſt: It is a hard thing, and yet a duty, to have a mans obedience at higheſt, when his comforts are at loweſt: it was one of the great difficulties that <hi>Luther</hi> found; <note place="margin">Luther.</note> there were three things he found very hard, he profeſſed, in Religion. One was, <hi>to believe that which was impoſsible:</hi> and another was, <hi>to hope for that which was delayed:</hi> and another was: <hi>to love God when God ſhewed himſelf an enemy,</hi> ſaith he, that my obedience ſhould be higheſt when my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts are at loweſt ebb: <hi>for a man to obey his voice, and ſerve him, and yet all the while to walk in darkneſs, and have no light;</hi> as it is in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.10. truly my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, this is a hard thing to ſay, <hi>I will love him though he kill me: I will truſt in him though he kill me:</hi> this you will ſay is a hard duty: O, ſuch things as theſe now, the holy man hath in his eyes, theſe are the marks he ſets himſelf to aim at.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for a mans ſoul to be loweſt when his employment is higheſt: for a man to be like a Spire-Steeple, <hi>minimus in ſummo,</hi> to have his ſpirit loweſt when his imployment is at the higheſt; it was ſo with <hi>Paul,</hi> in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. <hi>I have labored more abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then they all:</hi> cheifeſt in ſervice, the greateſt of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, but <hi>the leaſt of Saints,</hi> the leaſt of Saints: why
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:115739:45"/> this is a hard thing: O, we do find, there is not a poor creature imployed in a buſineſs, if he be honoured above his Brethren, but preſently how doth his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit riſe with his imployment! he grows ſo proud pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, the earth cannot bear him: we ſee examples of it every day: but here is holineſs, my Brethren, that ſets him this pattern, his ſpirit to be low, when his imployment is high.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, holineſs ſets a man this pattern, to be <hi>contented with the things that are preſent;</hi> that is the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles exhortation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. <hi>be contented with things that are preſent, or be ſufficient with them:</hi> let the things that are preſent be ſufficient to thee: whether I have much or little, honour or diſgrace, it is that that is preſent: Now for a man to ſubſcribe to the dealing of God, and to lay his hand upon his mouth, and to ſay, This is the diſpoſing of a wiſe Father, it is but <hi>in viaticum,</hi> it is not <hi>in praemium,</hi> it is but for my paſſage, it is not for my reward: then I ſay for a man to ſay tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Whatſoever I have here, if it be but enough to land me ſaſe in an other world, it is all I care for: O my Brethren, this is the pitch that the Saints of God now ſet to themſelves: where there is holineſs, I ſay, theſe difficult duties the ſoul propounds unto it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. But,</p>
                  <p>Further yet, Where there is holineſs, it propounds this, To look upon ſuffering as a gift: in <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.29. <hi>to you it is given, not only to believe, but to ſuffer for the name of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> Men can look upon imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as a gift ſometimes, if God will ſet them in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable ſervice: O but to look upon ſufferings as honorable, as if a man by that were to fill up that which is behind of the ſufferings of Chriſt: this is
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:115739:46"/> that pitch which the Saints ſet to themſelves: the mark they aim at, is ſuch difficult duties as theſe are, to look upon ſuffering as a gift, to ſay as in <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Let the brother of low degree rejoyce that he is exalied;</hi> I, there is reaſon for that; <hi>I, but ſhall the brother of high degree rejoyce that he is made low?</hi> Yes, that God hath called thee to any condition to do good: O that is a ſpiritual heart indeed, that is a holy heart indeed.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, there is yet another great truth, and that is, to have ſuch a ſpirit, willing to go alone in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and not to be turned out of the way: that if I am brought to duty, though I am left alone, yet notwithſtanding the duty is mine, the ſpecial aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is Gods. Man is a ſociable Creature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and he is in a great meaſure like a drop emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyed into the Sea, he is mightily apt to ſwim down with the tide: O tis a hard matter for a man to be willing in duty to go alone: yet ſo it was with <hi>Paul. At my firſt Anſwer all men for ſook me, no man ſtood by me:</hi> for a man to ſay, One God is ſufficient, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> I remember hath it upon <hi>Zach.</hi> 9.12. <hi>Go to the ſtrong holds ye priſoners of hope. Strong holds!</hi> they had no ſtrong hold, the City was burnt, and the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple deſtroyed, and they had no ſtrong hold to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themſelves to, <hi>turn to your ſtrong holds: Satis prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidii in uno Deo:</hi> but yet notwithſtanding ſaith he, there was ſuccour enough in one God. So ſaith the ſoul, There is ſociety and communion enough in one God: if no man ſtand by me in duty, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Lord will: for a man to go alone, and not to balk nor to be turned out of the way, becauſe he is deſerted by men, either by a principle of falſhood or Cowardice: truly this is one of the difficulteſt duties of Religion.</p>

                  <p>There is one thing more (I ſee I muſt break off) I will but name this one thing; and that is, To have a mans ſpirit raiſed by oppoſition, that the more he doth meet with oppoſition, in a way of duty, the more reſolute he is for it: ſo far is he from being afraid of the threatnings of men, of the frowns of men, he ſhall loſe this mans favour, incur ſuch a mans diſpleaſure, and loſe ſuch an advantage and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity: no, his ſpirit riſeth far more for it: it is with ſuch a man as it is with the fire in winter: the fire burns the hotter becauſe of the coldneſs of the air; ſo it is with ſuch a ſoul that is truly inflamed. Come to <hi>David</hi> and tell him, O there is a <hi>Goliah,</hi> and he is come out with a ſpear like a Weavers beam, and there is one that bears his target goes before him; where is he? ſaith <hi>David: I will fight with him,</hi> ſaith he; his ſpirit doth not fall by difficulties, but riſeth: I am not afraid of any uncircumciſed Philiſtim; my Brethren, this is a true noble ſpirit; holy greatneſs of mind lies in this; when a mans ſpirit is born up upon the greatneſs of his God, and the goodneſs of his Cauſe: it is a baſe ſpirit that is born up by the ſtrength of his party, I have ſo many men on my ſide; alaſs my Brethren, that is a baſe ſpirit; but I ſay, here is a true noble ſpirit, the greatneſs of his God, and the goodneſs of his Cauſe: and if that will not bear me out, ſaith the ſoul, let me ſink in it, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to periſh. I remember a godly man; the Lord, ſaith he, will make <hi>Jeremiahs face like an Adamant:</hi> ſaith he, like an Adamant, the hardeſt of ſtones? tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then let the ſtorm come, and the Adamant that ſhrinks not, it fears not, it changeth not its hue: no not a jot, the Adamant is the ſame. Certainly, my
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:115739:47"/> Beloved, this is the <hi>Motio</hi> of every truly noble ſpirit; <hi>Nec ſpe, nec timore,</hi> it is neither hope, nor fear that acts me; I can neither hope for any thing, ne ther truly am I afraid of any thing that man can do unto me; and he doth neither fear, nor faint, nor flie, but the more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties riſe, the more doth his ſpirit riſe: I ſay ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the greatneſs of his God, and the goodneſs of his cauſe; Now it ye be holy men, you do not pick and chuſe duties, but the more difficult duties are, the more you ſtrive to riſe to bring up your ſpirits to them; I that is holineſs, not to bring down the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to you, but to keep up the Law, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>the Law is holy, and juſt, and good;</hi> only labour you to bring up your ſpirits to the rule of it. If you are holy men now, it will be thus with you.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, a holy <hi>man hates every falſe way,</hi> and fears it, and recovers out of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.128. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.9. the word is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>, its to hate it as Hell it ſelf. Secondly, he fears it, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9.2. <hi>he that fears an oath,</hi> &amp;c. I fear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſin, ſaies the holy man. Thridly, he recovers himſelf; he doth not lie in his ſin; <hi>Peter</hi> ſinned, but <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> ſorrowed for his ſin; a good man is a <hi>living fountain,</hi> will never be drawn dry; grace is a living principle, it doth work out the mudd in the heart by degrees, as the Sun doth labour for ſome time with the miſt, but diſpels it at the laſt, the longer any man lies in ſin after a fall, the more unholy his heart is; to ſin preſently after du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is a ſign there hath been little communion with God in the duty: and to riſe preſently after ſin, is a ſign that God hath hold on the man, and <hi>that the root of the matter is in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, try it by this, if you hate your own ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, if that be your great care, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.23. <hi>Ezech.</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, it is then; he is to <hi>take heed to himſelf,</hi> as the exhortation is in <hi>Luke</hi> 8.13. you have been Conquerers, take heed now you be not overcome with the Devil: and you have fought for liberty, take heed you be not the worſt of ſlaves, as that man is that is a ſervant to his luſt: You have aſſerted the liberty of others, maintain your own liberty alſo, <hi>and be not the ſervants to ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, if you be holy, you will have <hi>reſpect unto all the commandments, Pſal.</hi> 119.6. he that doth deſpiſe any one Commandment, makes conſcience of none; it is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality that is the great note of ſincerity; now to live in the willing neglect of any known duty, and the Law of God comes in againſt a man, and the man is afraid to hear of ſuch a duty, becauſe his guilt ariſes, and his trouble is renewed thereby, and therefore the man would ſhift it off, &amp; would disburden himſelf of the ſenſ of it; ſurely then that ſoul has cauſe to fear, holineſs is not his aim: but now when the commandment comes, and the man is a co-worker with God as it were, and is willing it ſhould be ſet on upon his ſoul, and is not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to give himſelf a diſpenſation from it, but he ſaith, I muſt walk up to the extremity of the rule, and obſerve
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:115739:48"/> it to the uttermoſt extent of it, for I muſt be Judged by it, <hi>God will lay Judgement to the line,</hi> &amp;c. this is the ſenſe of a holy heart.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, if you are holy, your holineſs will anſwer the Law of God; for <hi>it is the Law written in the heart,</hi> that you muſt come up to; <hi>you have obeyed from the heart that forme of Doctrine which was delivered to you; we are caſt into it,</hi> as into a mold, and therefore it muſt be a perfect form; there are the <hi>great things of the Law,</hi> Rom. 11.17. Heb. 13.8,9. and it was the ſin of the Phariſees that they only regarded leſſer things, and left the great things of the Law undone: and its the great ſin of hypocrites whether it be in point of ſin, or in point of duty, to be only zealous againſt leſſer things: therefore trie your ſelves by theſe rules, for it is a matter of the greateſt concernment of your lives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By theſe may you know if you are in the way to the Beatifical viſion; by theſe may you judge of your <hi>holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi>

                  <p>Now you that have pleaſure in the works of God, ye are come before the Lord this day to enter an eminent National mercy upon publike record; and if ye ſearch into it, after a diligent ſcrutiny ye will find there are theſe ſix things ſpecially to <hi>be obſerved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</hi>

                  <p>Firſt; it is a return not only of late, but of antient prayers: It is one of the great Queſtions that the Saints of God have as matter to diſpute in all the mercies that they receive, whether they have them as effects of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, or as the heirs of the promiſe: whether they have of them only <hi>a jus Politicum,</hi> or <hi>Evangelicum?</hi> the one indeed <hi>non fundatur in Gratiâ;</hi> but the other is: now if it be given in anſwer to prayers, it is a <hi>birth of the promiſe,</hi> which the prayers of the Saints help to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver,

                  <p>But he doth wait to be gracious. Now delaying of the mercy doth raiſe the price of it; now ye come to reap of the harveſt of many of your prayers that are paſt and gone, that you even now gave for loſt: there is a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold joy that the Scripture ſpeaks of as tranſcendent; the joy of harveſt, and the joy of ſouldiers when they divide the ſpoil: and truly there is matter of both theſe joyes in this mercy adminiſtred to you; for you divide the ſpoil of the enemie, and with all you reap to your ſelves the harveſt of all your former prayers and petitions: Oh how did the pulpits in times paſt ſound with ſuch words as theſe, <hi>Lord, remember bleeding and dying</hi> Ireland; <hi>Lord, this is</hi> Ireland <hi>that is a caſt-out peopl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:115739:50"/> diſpleaſed and diſcontented <hi>with the return</hi> of their own prayers.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is a mercy given in when all things were deſperate, and even all hope of a deliverance was gone: Now <hi>is God a help found in the needful time of trouble:</hi> when the enemies power and confidence was high, and they ſaid <hi>Ireland</hi> is our own: we will purſue them, even take them and ſatisfie our luſts upon them: we will ſurely root out the <hi>Engliſh</hi> name from amongſt us, and we will try if they can ſwim into <hi>England:</hi> it may be their faith will bear them up, as that partie hath alwayes ſcoffed at godlineſs in all their ſucceſſes; but be no more mockers leaſt your bonds increaſe.</p>
                  <p>Now when you had not an Armie in the field, the whole Kingdom was their own, and not a Garriſon left in the whole Kingdom but one and that brought to the very brink of deſtruction alſo, and muſt have been ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred ſpeedily after they made their approaches to it; Now God gives in the mercy, now doth the Lord judge his people, and repent him concerning his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: when he ſees that <hi>their power is gone, and that there is none ſhut up or left, Deut</hi> 32.36. when there is no Army in the field, no ſouldiers in garriſon: now is the time that the Lord doth appear, and <hi>take to himſelf his great power and raign.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, when the Lord doth therein exceed the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of his ſervants; a deliverance they hoped for, but not ſo great, not ſo ſudden, ſo that when it came <hi>they ſeemed as men that dream,</hi> and they can ſcarce believe that God would do ſo great things for them, when the Lord is come to do them: <hi>when the ſon of man comes, ſhall he find faith upon earth?</hi> its a faith in reference to the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:115739:50"/> coming of Chriſt for to take vengeance on the Churches adverſaries, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.3. <hi>thou didſt great things for us which we looked not for;</hi> for God doth not anſwer prayers according unto our hopes, but according to his own mercies; as he doth not reward our ſervices accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the meaſure of our duty, but <hi>in the mouth of mercy, Hoſ.</hi> 10.12. a man doth ſow in duty, but he doth reap—<hi>in ore—miſericordiae.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, when it is by the hand of thoſe whom they have oppreſſed; when <hi>the witneſſes that were ſlain ſhall riſe again, and they ſhall deſtroy their perſecutors by the ſword that comes out of their mouthes,</hi> then it is the greater mercy, and far the greater confuſion unto the enemy; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.15. <hi>When the worm</hi> Jacob <hi>ſhall threſh the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and when the arm of the Lord ſhould be made bare in it,</hi> and his hand more immediately ſeen, beyond the purpoſe, courage and intention of men, they are enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged before they are aware, and victorie is won before they know they are engaged in a Battle: when the <hi>Lord ſhall bend Judah</hi> for him, <hi>and fill his bow with Ephraim,</hi> and they ſhall have the honour of the conqueſt, that have had their great ſhare in their Torments, and were by the enemies deſigned for deſtruction, and they ſhall fall by their hand, it makes the mercy far the greater.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, when it is ſuch a mercy as lets us ſee ſtill that God owns the ſame cauſe, and however men warp and turn too and fro, yet the good old cauſe in which the people of God were engaged againſt the Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian party, the Lord owns that cauſe ſtill, and gives un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his people hereby hopes of a ſettlement: For the Lord Chriſt when he rides forth in the conqueſt of the Goſpel, he doth ride forth <hi>conquering and to conquer</hi> (not
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:115739:51"/> all at once) but by degrees, and doth give to his people yet a ground of their faith to ſee, <hi>if they be of the ſeed of the Jews before whom they have begun to fall,</hi> they ſhall ſurely fall; God hath given us therein, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.15. <hi>the vally of</hi> Achor <hi>for a door of hope;</hi> it is true that <hi>Achor</hi> was a pleaſant vally, and it was ſweet in it ſelf; therefore it was joyned with <hi>Carmel</hi> and <hi>Baſhan;</hi> but yet it was much more ſweet in reference to the hope: for it was at the firſt entrance into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and as the firſt fruits gives them poſſeſſion of the whole.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, it is ſtill a carrying on of the grand deſign that the Lord Chriſt hath to do in the world in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter daies; for Chriſt in glory hath not only Saints to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther home to himſelf, and to bind them all up in <hi>a bundle of life,</hi> and he doth raign for their ſakes, for he is <hi>the head over all</hi> things for the Churches ſake: but the Lord hath alſo enemies to be ſubdued; <hi>he muſt raign till he hath put all his enemies under his feet,</hi> and he will be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as the Fathers <hi>ſervant</hi> in the one, as well as in the other: therefore, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. there <hi>is a harveſt of all the Saints to be reaped,</hi> and there is <hi>a wine preſs of wicked</hi> men at the ſame time <hi>to be trodden,</hi> &amp;c. Now the great enemy unto Chriſt in the latter daies of the world is, <hi>that wicked one</hi>

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:115739:51"/> which I ſhall preſent you but with theſe three conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the leaſt return that you can make of a mercy, is praiſe to God for it; and it is all that the Lord doth expect of you. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. <hi>and we will give thee the calves of our lips:</hi> it is all the promiſe, that the Lord would have his people make to him <hi>in the time of</hi> their ſtraits. Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions they are ſtupefactive and of a confounding na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and they cloſe the mouth, <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>r.</hi> 8.14. <hi>let us enter into our fenced Cities, and let us be ſilent there, for the Lord our God hath put us to ſilence:</hi> but mercies they are of an expanſive and dilating nature, and they open the mouth: as <hi>Hannah,</hi> not only her heart, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.1. <hi>was filled,</hi> but her mouth was enlarged alſo.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if you do not return praiſes for mercies, God will ſurely add Judgements unto mercies, and will turn his hand againſt you, <hi>do you evil after he hath done you good: Hezekiah</hi> received a mercy, but <hi>he did not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der according to the mercy:</hi> and this brought a Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon him and upon the whole land, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> for let me tell you, of all things God can leaſt bear the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing and contempt of his mercies: there are two things that are very terrible to the Saints, and that they are afraid of, and would be preſerved from. Firſt that they reap not curſes from the Ordinances of God, which are uſually the great means of bleſſing. Secondly, that they have not Judgements grow out of mercies, becauſe of their unanſwerable walking under their preſent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly the praiſes of the Saints are as terrible unto the Churches enemies as their prayers: you think it is your duty to pray often: truly it is your duty to praiſe God alſo: for <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.2. <hi>out of the mouth of Babes and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:115739:52"/> ſucklings he hath ordained ſtrength to ſtill the enemy and the avenger:</hi> it is ſpoken of Satan, and of all ſpiritual ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.

Now I ſhall chuſe to put both theſe together, and to underſtand it of heavenly Angels, which the Lord Chriſt imploys in theſe adminiſtrations, which have the firſt hand in the work: and alſo all men, all ſorts of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments and officers, that thoſe Angels do ſtir up and imploy; for <hi>the Spirit of the living creatures is in the wheels;</hi> and <hi>when I am gone forth the Prince of grace ſhall come:</hi> therefore the Angels, and the Inſtruments ſtirrd up, and acted by the Angels, the Lord looks upon as but one perſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that firſt the ruine of <hi>Rome</hi> and all the <hi>Roman</hi> power is committed unto an Angel; and therefore if all the power of the earth were engaged for it to ſupport <hi>Rome,</hi> yet this Angel is a mighty Angel, and he will ſurely deſtroy it: and if an Angel hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken it, he will not want inſtruments, thoſe that he will ſurely in all ages ſtir up to effect it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Romes</hi> ruine as it is the work and office of the Angel, ſo it is unto the Angels matter of joy and triumph: for as the converſion of the Saints is joy to the Angels, ſo is the deſtruction of the enemies alſo;
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:115739:53"/> but eſpecially unto thoſe Angels that are employed as officers therein, as <hi>Ezech.</hi> 9.1. there are <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> unto the Angels the ordering of that great work was committed; and therefore they are ſaid to <hi>have the charge of it;</hi> the Babyloniſh Armie did the work, but the <hi>Angel</hi> that had the charge of it ordered it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, of whom is this ſpoken? it is ſpoken of <hi>Babylon, Rev.</hi> 17.12.3. there is <hi>a woman ſeen riding upon a ſcarlet-coloured Beaſt, full of names of blaſphemy, having ſeven heads and ten horns;</hi> and <hi>this woman hath written upon her forchead, myſterie,</hi> Babylon <hi>the great the mother of Harlots:</hi> who is it? ver. laſt, its <hi>that great City that reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth over the Kings of the Earth:</hi> Now this could not be litterally <hi>Babylon;</hi> for that was deſtroyed many hundred years before <hi>Johns</hi> time; but this is <hi>Babylon</hi> in a myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; the City that now rules over the Kings of the earth, and that was only <hi>Rome;</hi> a <hi>woman that did ſit upon many waters;</hi> (that is <hi>reigned over Kingdoms and Nations and people,</hi> &amp;c) and this woman is brought in <hi>riding,</hi> which is an Emblem and expreſſion of power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority throughout this whole book: Now what is the <hi>Beaſt</hi> that the woman rides upon? it is <hi>regnum ſive im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perium Romanum,</hi> which becauſe of its blood and its cruelty, hath been alwaies expreſſed by a <hi>Beaſt with a ſcarlet colour,</hi> &amp;c. and this hath three names given to it throughout this book: for all the old enemies, that were ever any of the antient perſecutors of the Church, is to be found in her, <hi>the blood of all the Saints;</hi> therefore <hi>is</hi> ſaid <hi>to be found in her,</hi> becauſe in her was the cruelty of all former perſecutors to be found, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.8. <hi>ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Egypt, &amp; Sodom:</hi> not litterally <hi>Sodom;</hi> for their filthineſs called <hi>Sodom,</hi> and for their <hi>Idolatry Egypt and Babylon:</hi> for there is all Idolatry, Sorcery &amp; Cruelty; ſo that the evils
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:115739:54"/> that have been in all former perſecutors, is to be found in them: and therefore it is called <hi>Babylon</hi> by way of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion, as the <hi>Churches of Chriſt</hi> are called <hi>Zion</hi> and <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, and the Iſrael of God, Rev.</hi> 7. the Lord keeping to the old names: ſo the enemies alſo are called <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Lord keeping unto the old names and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient reſemblances: So then <hi>Rome</hi> and the power there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is here meant by <hi>Babylon:</hi> for it is to be underſtood in a myſterie, or in a ſpiritual ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, why is it called <hi>Babylon</hi> the great? I anſwer it is called ſo upon a double ground.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe of the greatneſs of its ſtrength, and glory; it was the ſtrongeſt and the moſt fortified place in the world; in ſo much that when the Lord did employ <hi>Cyrus</hi> in the work, it was thirteen years ſiege, that they were fain to cut the <hi>River Euphrates</hi> into chanels, and draw it dry, and enter the Citie by the chanels of the River; in that pit where <hi>Beltſhazer</hi> the King and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the City were found to be all of them bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried: and ſhe was the original of the Nations unto which they did all bring their glory: and ſo it is with this Citie, <hi>the merchants and the great men of the earth trade with her,</hi> as <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.3. ſo that to ſee <hi>Romam in ſlore</hi> is one of the gloriouſeſt ſights that this lower world could afford, which <hi>Fulgentius</hi> admiring, raiſed up his heart higher by this conſideration, <note place="margin">Fulgentius</note> 
                     <hi>Quantum ſplendeat coeleſtis Hieruſalem, cum adeo fulgeat terreſtis Roma?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is alſo <hi>Babylon</hi> the great, becauſe of the greatneſs of their power, and dominion: She <hi>did ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on many waters,</hi> and <hi>did rule all the Kings of the earth,</hi> as <hi>Babylon</hi> did ſay of old, <hi>Are not my Princes altogether Kings?</hi> and therefore, becauſe of their dominion, they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the great City, and the great City that <hi>rules over the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:115739:54"/> Kings of the Earth;</hi> and yet this great <hi>Lucifer, ſon of the morning, muſt fall from Heaven and be brought down un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the duſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly how is it ſaid, is fallen? put in <hi>praeterito;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt it is put in the <hi>Preterperfect;</hi> and that is ordinary with the Hebrews.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly by</hi> way of Ingemination: and they do imply, Firſt certainly: for it is a ſpeech of faith, ſpeaking of <hi>things to come as if they were</hi> already paſt. Secondly it notes the ſuddenneſs of it; it was at hand; as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>it is finiſhed,</hi> that is, it was now neer to be ended; and ſo, <hi>it is fallen:</hi> that is, <hi>ſubito ruitura.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly it notes an utter ruine and deſtruction in the fall; for <hi>it is fallen, it is fallen;</hi> (that is) it is greatly, eminently, utterly fallen.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it is a deſtruction generally publiſhed over all the world, and with a great deal of joy ſpoken of by the Saints, as appears afterward, <hi>when they give God the glory of taking vengeance of the great whore,</hi> &amp;c. for the repetitions in Scripture do really note great affection, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.1. <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me? Pſal.</hi> 137.7, <hi>Down with it, down with it to the ground:</hi> as <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.23. <hi>Abſolom my Son, my Son:</hi> and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.10. <hi>precept upon precept, line upon line,</hi> &amp;c. the expreſſion is taken from <hi>Iſa.</hi> 21.9. <hi>Babylon is fallen, is fallen,</hi> &amp;c. its ſpoken of antient and litteral <hi>Babylon,</hi> and it is applyed unto <hi>myſtical Babylon, Rev.</hi> 14.8. there we have a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold diſcovery of Antichriſt. Firſt, <hi>there is an Angel flies with the everlaſting Goſpel;</hi> and they do publiſh the Doctrine of the grace of God in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> openly againſt all the inventions of men: and denounce Judgements againſt all Idolatry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Rome</hi> not repenting thereof, now the Lord declares it to be <hi>Babylon,</hi> and a
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:115739:55"/> Church of God no more, and now <hi>it is fallen. Jam Ruinae Babylonis jaciuntur fundamenta:</hi> and now the Lord having declared it to be <hi>Babylon,</hi> doth begin to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare war againſt it. Thirdly, then the people of God riſe higher, and declare no communion with her, and <hi>that whoever doth receive her mark and Image, he ſhall drink of the pure wine of the wrath of God, without mixture:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luther.</note> 
                     <hi>effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am brevi ut Anathema ſit eſſe Papiſtam:</hi> Luther.</p>
                  <p>But now the work is at hand; there is none of the enemies of Chriſt ſo great as <hi>myſterie Babylon:</hi> and there is none of his enemies towards whom he hath uſed ſo much patience and long ſuffering, bringing them to deſtruction but by degrees: ſeveral <hi>vials</hi> have been pouring out upon her; degrees of wrath poured out upon them, and yet every one of theſe degrees is <hi>a fall of Babylon:</hi> but yet the laſt and utter ruine of it is to come: but it haſt ens, for <hi>the word is gone forth of the mouth of the Lord,</hi> that he will have war with this <hi>Romiſh Amaleck,</hi> and never have peace with it, till it be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: <hi>He hath ſaid, Great</hi> Babylon <hi>is fallen,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Hence the Obſervations are Three:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Rome, <hi>myſterie Babylon ſhall certainly fall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly, It ſhall utterly fall,</hi> and be broken with breach upon breach, and deſtroyed with a double deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly, The fall of it the Saints of God look upon as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the greateſl joy and Triumph;</hi> Babylon <hi>is fallen, is fallen; it is a joyful voice to be heard in Sion by the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants thereof, and they that ſtand with the Lamb there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</hi>
                  </p>
               </div>
               <div n="1" type="doctrine">
                  <head>Doctrine.</head>
                  <p>The Doctrine from hence is: <hi>Rome,</hi> that is, <hi>myſtical Babylon ſhall certainly fall:</hi> which will appear if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe particulars:</p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:115739:55"/>
                  <p>Firſt, conſider the enemie that hath ſet himſelf againſt <hi>Rome;</hi> is one that is able to effect it, and that is the great and the Almighty God: and if he lift up his hand to reap, if he whet his glittering ſword, he will ſurely make a ſlaughter, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.8. <hi>ſtrong is the Lord God who judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her:</hi> it is true, <hi>Babylon</hi> hath all the ſtrength of the earth on her party, <hi>the Kings of the earth do bring their glory to her, and give their power and ſtrength to the Beaſt;</hi> it is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, all their natural power and ſtrength is given to her, and all their civil power and ſtrength or authority: and therefore a man would think it impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for any to <hi>make war with the Beaſt:</hi> But they have a ſtrong God againſt them, and he hath undertaken it, and the Lord will never make peace with <hi>Rome:</hi> this is that ſpiritual <hi>Amalek with whom God will never make peace from Generation to Generation:</hi> there be ſome of the enemies of God that ſhall be converted in the latter daies: and many of thoſe Kings the Lamb ſhall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, not by their deſtruction, but by their converſion: for he will uphold them afterward, though they had been his enemies: but with <hi>Rome</hi> he will never have peace, but will be a profeſſed enemy unto them for ever: the enmity between God and them is like the enmity between <hi>the ſeed of the woman and of the Serpent,</hi> that ſhall never be reconciled, never have an end.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, look upon the cauſes of their deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and they are mainly four, and all of them will bring eminent deſtruction with them:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe they corrupted Religion, and that both in doctrine and worſhip: they <hi>have made all the Nations of the earth drunk with the wine of her fornication;</hi> and this they have done <hi>in a golden cup:</hi> they make fair and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pretences, and call themſelves the Church of

                     <hi>Ludov.

                  <p>Secondly, becauſe <hi>the Kings of the earth have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted fornication with her; Rome</hi> hath been the great cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupter of Kings, and of all men that have been eminent in authority; and this is their laſt refuge, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.14. they ſend forth their <hi>Emiſſaries</hi> unto the Kings of the Earth, and of the whole world: it is a great influence that they have had upon the authority of the world: Now Kings they ſtand in the place of God, and <hi>bear his Image</hi> in reſpect of government: to have them corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted is a great provocation unto God, and a great occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of deſtruction unto the world.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, by reaſon of her <hi>merchandize, the merchants of the earth are waxed rich</hi> through her delicacies: what is this merchandize? it cannot be meant of merchandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes in a litteral and proper ſenſe: where it is ſaid, <hi>ver.</hi> 11.12. <hi>the merchants of the earth ſhall weep and mourn over her,</hi> &amp;c. not that men ſhall merchandize no more for gold, and pearl, and precious things, which ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly merchants trade about: the merchandize of them ſhall not ceaſe when <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall be deſtroyed: for the world ſhall continue, and trading ſhall ſtill be.

                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, for her cruelty, <hi>Chap.</hi> 18.24. <hi>in her was found the blood of the Prophets, and of all the Saints that were ſlain upon the earth;</hi> and God will not ſuffer the blood of his Sains to lie unrevenged the cry of blood the Lord cannot deny to hear, though it be but the blood of men: but much more the blood of Saints: for <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in his ſight is their blood; he hath a bottle for their tears,</hi> much more will he <hi>make inquiſition for blood:</hi> and if the blood of any one of his Saints be ſuch a burthen that God cannot bear it at the hands of men; how much more when the blood of all the Saints ſhall be ſhed, <hi>the Prophets and Martyrs of Jeſus?</hi> Specially conſidering that their cruelty ſhall grow, and they ſhall be mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thirdly, it is the great deſign that Chriſt hath in the latter daies of the world, to deſtroy this <hi>Beaſt; the laſt enemy,</hi> Dan. 7. <hi>is the fourth Beaſt: and in the fourth Beaſt there is a little horn that ſhall be more ſierce then his fellows:</hi> and ver. 11. <hi>before that the words that the horn ſpake, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held till the Beaſt was deſtroyed:</hi> all the Roman power doth periſh in the little horn: in the deſtruction of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, all the Roman power ſhall be utterly broken: there were ten horns that did ariſe upon the riſe of the Beaſt, and there was government given them, and power
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:115739:57"/> ſucceſſively: but when this little horn ſhall be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: never a horn ſhall ſtand up in the place thereof any more; and therefore, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. we ſee <hi>the vials</hi> that are <hi>poured out</hi> are but degrees of wrath upon <hi>Rome</hi> Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and we have ſeen many of them in a very glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and unexpected way already accompliſhed, and therefore we have great cauſe to truſt Chriſt for the effecting of the reſt; and he will turn the heart of the <hi>Kings againſt them that they ſhall hate the whore;</hi> they that did ſupport her, they ſhall become the greateſt inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to deſtroy her; as the ſeals have had their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect upon <hi>Rome</hi> Pagan, and the <hi>Trumpets</hi> upon <hi>Rome</hi> Chriſtian, ſo ſhall the <hi>vials</hi> upon <hi>Rome</hi> Antichriſtian; for this book of the <hi>Revelations</hi> doth mainly concern <hi>Rome:</hi> for there is a double propheſie; <hi>fata Eccleſiae &amp; Imperii:</hi> and they are the two great works Chriſt hath in deſign after his aſcention.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it ſhall ſurely be deſtroyed, becauſe they ſhall never repent, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.9,11. <hi>When the vial is pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out upon the world, they were ſcorched with ſire;</hi> exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly enraged, <hi>and they blaſphemed the name of God which had power over theſe plagues, but they repented not to give glory:</hi> and upon the ſeat of the Beaſt, <hi>they Blaſphemed God becauſe of their pain, but repented not of their evil deeds;</hi> and the ground of it is, becauſe moſt of them generally, they that embrace the Doctrine and worſhip, are reprobates: and the Scripture doth make it a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſign of reprobation, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.8.17.8. They that wonder, who are they? ſuch whoſe names are not wrote in the Book of life from the foundation of the world: Now if men be under the hand of God in wrath, and one judgement doth make way for another, God will puniſh them ſeven times more: ſurely they muſt be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:115739:57"/> deſtroyed at the laſt: ſo it was with <hi>Rome,</hi> one Judgement makes way for another: and one <hi>vial</hi> doth prepare and fit the ſubject for another: So that as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Saints one mercy doth but prepare the ſubject, and open the door unto another, ſo alſo to ungodly men one judgement makes way for another, and their hearts are hardned unto their own deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, it is the expectation of Chriſt, and all the Saints, and all their prayers have been poured out this way. Firſt it is the expectation of Chriſt, he is <hi>ſate down at the right hand of God, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                     <note place="margin">Brightman</note> 
                     <hi>Brightman.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the degrees of wrath that <hi>Rome</hi> hath had upon her, hath been from the prayers of the Saints, and not by their Power, and it hath been their expectation long ago, that <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould be utterly ruined: <note place="margin">Lactantius</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now God that hath raiſed this expectation in the hearts of his people, and drawn out this ſupplication, he will not fruſtrate their expectations, he will fulfill their petitions.</p>

Here the judgements of God that he exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes upon men, have mercy mixed with them; there is a mixture of light with all their darkneſs, <hi>non dantur puraetenebrae:</hi> but in Hell there ſhall be judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without mercy, and fury without compaſſion: and truly the judgement that ſhall come upon <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall have a great reſemblance of the Torments of Hell with it: and therefore their judgement is very ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it ſhall be an utter deſtruction, which ſhall be the more Tormenting becauſe it ſhall be in the height of their hopes, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.7. <hi>when ſhe ſhall ſay, I ſet as a Queen, and am no widd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thirdly, the judgement ſhall come upon all parties,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:115739:58"/> and upon all degrees and conditions of men that joyn with them; all thoſe that do partake of their ſins, ſhall have a ſhare of the plagues: there is <hi>a vial upon the earth,</hi> that is upon the common people.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, there will be a vial alſo upon <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, <hi>the throne of the Beaſt;</hi> in the Lords time, all this will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, and the day haſtens apace, and there is no degree from the higheſt to the loweſt that ſhall eſcape: no place ſhall protect a man; for the vial is poured out by the Lord, and there is no eſcaping.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, there is an utter deſolation deſcribed; it <hi>ſhall become an habitationfor Devils,</hi> which love to be in ſolitary and deſolate places, and it ſhall be <hi>a cage for every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean and hateful bird;</hi> as <hi>Sodom</hi> was, it ſhall be a monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of wrath unto all the world, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 13.19,20. <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.22,23. <hi>The voice of Harpers and Trumpeters ſhall be heard no more in thee,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>the light of a candle ſhall ſhine no more at all in thee,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, God will ſtir up the Inſtruments of venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to do their utmoſt to deſtroy them; as he had before put it in the hearts of the 10. Kings to ſet her up: ſo ſhal he alſo put it into their hearts to caſt her down, <hi>they ſhall make her deſolate and naked, and eat her fleſh, and burn her with fire,</hi> Rev. 17.16. and Rev. 18.6. <hi>reward her as ſhe rewarded you,</hi> double upon her double: and if the Lord put a principle of vengeance into the hearts of men, and

                  <p>Laſtly, it ſhall make way for their eternal deſtruction. For a man to undergo Temporal afflictions, though they be grievous, yet it were not ſo much, ſo <hi>his ſoul might be ſaved in the day of the Lord:</hi> but when <hi>death goes before, and Hell follows after,</hi> this is the greateſt miſery: Now this is the condition of all that <hi>follow the Beaſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his mark, whoſe names are not written in the Book of the Lamb;</hi> and therefore <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.20. <hi>the Beaſt was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and the falſe Prophet, and they were caſt alive into a Lake that did burn with fire and brimſtone:</hi> Truly then it is terrible when judgements do make way for a mans everlaſting deſtruction, and eternal ruine.</p>

                     <hi>The deſtruction of</hi> Rome, <hi>and every degree of it, the Saints of God do look upon as matter of joy and triumph:</hi> the righteous ſhall be glad when he ſees the vengeance that ſhall come upon <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſhall with a holy ſcorn ſay, as they do upon the fall of litteral <hi>Babylon, Iſa.</hi> 14. <hi>How art thou fallen from Heaven, O Lucifer, ſon of the morning:</hi> Rev. 19.1. <hi>There is a voice of much people in Heaven:</hi> Heaven that is put for the Church, <hi>ſaying, Amen Hallelujah, becauſe the Lord had judged the great whore,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But, what is there in their deſtruction that is ſuch matter of joy? to hear of the ſhedding of blood, and the deſtruction of many thouſands, and thoſe many of them poor ſouls very unfit to dye? to ſee them <hi>in gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments rouled in blood,</hi> is this matter of joy? a man would rather think you ſhould rather ſit down and ſigh, to the breaking of your loins. There are many things in it matter of joy and triumph unto the Saints; as firſt they rejoyce in the Judgements of God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19 2. <hi>True and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:115739:59"/> righteous are thy judgements; for thou haſt judged the great whore;</hi> they do taſte a ſweetneſs even in the judgements of God, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.1. <hi>it was in my belly as honey;</hi> even that roll which contained nothing but bitter lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yet it was very ſweet to him: the Saints love to ſee Chriſt <hi>with his ſword girt upon his thigh: and cloathed with a veſture dipt in blood, and treading the wine-preſs alone,</hi> travelling <hi>in the greatneſs of his ſtrength, Iſa.</hi> 63.1,2.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, becauſe God hath appeared for the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches cauſe, and hath owned their quarrel, and <hi>hath aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the blood of his ſervants</hi> at their hands, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.2. when God doth appear for them, and doth not leave them unto the will of their enemies, but <hi>doth awake as a Giant</hi> in the behalf of his people, this hath alwaies occaſioned ſongs and rejoycing in his people; <hi>the Lord hath triumphed gloriouſly over the horſe &amp; his rider, Exo.</hi> 15. not that they do triumph meerly upon the account of their own ſafety: but they triumph becauſe God hath triumphed over his enemies: elſe to ſee ſo many drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the mercyleſs grave, who would not have pittyed them?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, of all the Churches enemies that ever were, this is the crueleſt enemy; <hi>the fourth beaſt</hi> is worſe then any of the former; and in the fourth beaſt <hi>the little horn was more fierce then his fellows;</hi> they have been alwaies drunk with blood, and their endeavour <hi>was to weare out the Saints of the moſt High.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it ſhall be the laſt enemy; for as ſoon as they ſhall be deſtroyed, the <hi>ſeventh Trumpet ſounds, and then ſhall the myſtery of God be finiſhed:</hi> it hath been an enemy to the Church of longeſt continuance of any: their oppreſſions have lain longeſt upon the Church
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:115739:60"/> of God; and the longer a burthen doth lie and hath been complained of, the greater mercy you would count it to have it taken off: if to be 430. years in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and 70. years in <hi>Babylon,</hi> be a long time for the people of God to indure: yet this is a bondage that laſts 1260. daies in the greateſt tyranny and rage that can be: they <hi>Tread down the Temple,</hi> Rev. 11.1,2.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, when this enemy ſhall be deſtroyed, the cup of her fornication ſhall be removed, by which the men of the earth, but ſpecially the <hi>Kings of the earth</hi> have been made drunken, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.11. Now there is no man ſhall be their merchants more: they had Chap-men abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly before, but now there ſhall be a dealing in that trade no more: the ſame God that did caſt out Satan in the Pagan way of Idolatry, will alſo caſt out Satan in the Antichriſtian way of Idolatry: but <hi>they ſhall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the earth</hi> by ſuch ſorceries <hi>any more:</hi> for there is by this means <hi>a cloud that hath filled the houſe, and no man could enter into the Temple,</hi> Rev. 15.8. there was no conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable number of menconverted, there was ſuch a dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and a ſmoake upon the ordinances of God and all his diſpenſations: but all ſhall be removed.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Laſtly from the glorious fruit and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences that ſhall follow upon the deſtruction of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, the people of God will have great cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce and praiſe God: Ile name only theſe four.</p>
                  <p>Firſt <hi>then the Kingdoms of the world ſhall become the Kingdom of the Lord and of his Chriſt, Rev.</hi> 11.15. there ſhall be multitudes converted unto the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Secondly it ſhall be the inlet of all the promiſes: now Chriſt ſhall be called, <hi>the word of God:</hi> he was ſo before, but now he is called ſo for the accompliſhment of it:
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:115739:60"/> as <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.6. <hi>by the name Jehovah God was not known unto them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, then all perſecutions ſhall ceaſe, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. <hi>Satan ſhall be bound,</hi> ſo that he ſhall not ſtir up the world to the perſecution of the Saints, as he had done in times paſt.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>New Jeruſalm ſhall come down from God out of Heaven;</hi> there ſhall be that glory of the Church that <hi>the Kingdom and dominion under the whole Heavens ſhall be given up to it, and they ſhall poſſeſs it for ever and ever,</hi> Dan. 7. <hi>the mountain of the Lords houſe ſhall be exalted on the top of the mountains;</hi> there is a triumphant ſtate of the Church that is yet to come in this life: when all the glory of the world ſhall be brought unto the Church and people of God.</p>

Ile only ſpeak briefly to theſe five particulars, to
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:115739:61"/> quicken you in this duty of praiſing God.</p>
                  <p>Firſt it is a command that God doth give to all his Saints to rejoyce at <hi>Babylons</hi> downfal, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.20. <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce over her thou heaven; univerſa ſanctorum multitudo,</hi> all the <hi>Saints,</hi> but ſpecially the <hi>Prophets</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> the ſaithful Preachers of the word of God, let not them be laſt in their joy and praiſes, that had the great hand and were firſt in praying for it: it is your duty, and it lies as a command upon you, and if you make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of other commands, do not for fancies diſpence with this.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they be <hi>Romes merchants</hi> only that be ſad at it; let them ſay, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.10. <hi>Alas alas that great City</hi> Babylon, <hi>that mighty City:</hi> this doth not befit the Sons of Zion, but the <hi>merchants of Babylon;</hi> and truly let me tell you, a <hi>man may receive the mark of the beaſt in his right hand,</hi> and may ſtrongly promote the Popiſh inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, that doth never wear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thirdly, if <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhall fall, <hi>then come out of her my people, ſaith your God:</hi> when <hi>Rome</hi> doth fall, now is the time to preach that Doctrine: there may be many of the Elect of God that may <hi>deliteſcere,</hi> and be enſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by <hi>Rome</hi> ſome way or other, that do not wholly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Beaſt, and <hi>receive his Image:</hi> but how ever now God goes forth in Judgement, <hi>come out of her:</hi> let me exhort you in the name of the Lord, do not cleave to <hi>Rome:</hi> now <hi>you will ſurely partake in her plagues, if you do joyn with her in her ſins:</hi> and if you take part with her now, you come in at the worſt time when it is falling, when Popery is falling: now ye that have been againſt it, prayed againſt it, fought againſt it, and now by a wile to be brought into it to ſupport it, when it is falling,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:115739:61"/> now its Judgement is at hand, it is the greateſt vanity that can be.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly: then a man were better with patience ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with <hi>Sion,</hi> and the Churches party a while: rather then joyn with the Romiſh partie and be ruined with them in his end, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.12. <hi>here is the patience of the Saints;</hi> ye ſhall ſuffer a while and be trodden down by them, and you muſt ſtay for the full accompliſhment of this promiſe for your deliverance; <hi>but I will ſurely come and will recompence all your patience;</hi> and therefore be nor diſcouraged and faint in your minds, let not your hearts turn back unto <hi>Egypt,</hi> and hanker after <hi>Rome,</hi> and thoſe <hi>remnants of Baal,</hi> which God will ſurely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, how abundant ſhould you be now in prayer for theſe two reaſons?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe the time draws neer, now your prayers ſhall not be long unanſwered, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.19. and ye ſhall be ſure of a gracious anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Lord doth let you ſee, that he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun the work; now follow him: the Promiſes do begin to <hi>bring forth,</hi> let us not be wanting to aſſiſt them in the <hi>birth:</hi> if ever you would pray, do it now, when God is doing the mercy: and you may expect a preſent return: the Judgements of God upon his enemies and yours do invite your prayers.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, beg of God for your Governors, that they may never comply with Rome: which hath brought ſo great miſeries upon all Chriſtian Princes and eſtates, complying with Rome upon Politick reſpects, thoug not upon Religious: O let us abhorr it, and deſire God to keep their hearts from it: for Rome ſhall periſh <hi>Babylon ſhall fall;</hi> and truly there is no partie be the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:115739:62"/> what they will be, and let his reſpect be what it will, that do comply with them, but they will fall with them; for they are the people of Gods curſe, with whom God will never make peace, and therefore neither ſhould we: Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Motto was, <hi>No peace with Spain:</hi> So I ſay, <hi>No peace with Rome:</hi> and truly that is the way to have peace amongſt your ſelves, and to have your work carried on ſtrongly, when you do firmly <hi>ſtand with the Lamb upon mount Sion;</hi> and be not ſhaken ſometimes this way and ſometimes that way: ſavouring this way, and then another, as it ſerves our Politick ends: <hi>God is with you whileſt you be with him;</hi> and if you be through for him he will be ſo for you; if you be not, the Lord will ſurely leave you to periſh by that hand with whom you ſinfully comply: as the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did when they complyed with <hi>Aſſyria:</hi> if they will go to King <hi>Jareb,</hi> or go to <hi>Egypt</hi> for help they ſhall ſurely by the ſame hand periſh, and the Judgement came upon them from their helpers in the end.</p>

                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Alvin</hi> upon this place ſaith, that the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches perfection doth ſtand in theſe two things, in their faith, and in their order: and indeed all things that are neceſſary to its glory, that it may be <hi>preſented without ſpot to God,</hi> are to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:115739:63"/> be reduced to theſe heads: It is <hi>your perfection that I</hi> earneſtly <hi>deſire,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.9. Therefore I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to inſtruct you in both theſe: that you may be led on to perfection by it. As for matters of faith, it hath been the conſtant courſe of my miniſterie amongſt you; Now I ſhall ſpeak ſomething to matters of order; that ſo there may be no part of the councel of God that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns your duty hid from you.</p>
               <p>Now the order of a <hi>Church</hi> doth conſiſt in three things: and ſo I find the word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> uſed in the Scripture. Firſt it is put for the holy and orderly walking of every particular member, when they do all walk by rule, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Warn them that are unruly, diſorderly,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Withdraw from every brother that walks diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly:</hi> (that is) that doth not walk with a right foot towards the Goſpel: whoſe <hi>converſation is not holy as becomes the Goſpel of Chriſt:</hi> and ſo order belongs unto mens converſion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is put for the right adminiſtration of all the Ordinances of God, according to the rules and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.5,6. <hi>The order of Melchizedeck,</hi> is nothing elſe but the Inſtitutions, or preſcribed rules given unto <hi>Melchizedeck;</hi> and the <hi>order of Aaron,</hi> are the rules preſcribed by God for the Prieſthood of <hi>Aaron:</hi> and ſo <hi>Bezaon Hebrews,</hi> cap. 7.15. makes the word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to be all one: and ſo we uſe it, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.13. <hi>We ſought him not after the due order:</hi> that is, according to the rule, and to the inſtitutions of God: ſo that when all ordinances are adminiſtred accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Lords Inſtitution, that is <hi>the order of the Church;</hi> for then the order of God is obſerved.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it notes the due ſubordination that is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Chriſt to be obſerved in the Church: for
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:115739:63"/> that alſo <hi>is order,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.23. <hi>All ſhall ariſe, but every man in his own order: Firſt Chriſt, and then they that are Chriſts</hi> at his coming: and ſo order is oppoſed to confuſion, when no man knows nor keeps his own place and ſtation in the body: When they that rule, keep their place, and they that are to be ruled keep their place: and they do it with ſubjection to Chriſt, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concluded under the Power of an Inſtitution, that is properly <hi>order:</hi> for the word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is military, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the order of an Armie: Now there are three things that make an orderly army.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that every ſouldier walks honeſtly, and doth not oppreſs and run out of their rank.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that the Governors and Commanders do keep their places and do their duty in them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that all that is to be done, be done accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto the rule of the Commanders; and by their the Souldiers do nothing of themſelves, and by their own appointments; and this is properly the order of an Armie: when every one doth keep his own rank, doth his own duty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhould <hi>ſpeak of</hi> the orderly adminiſtring of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. Secondly, the orderly walking of members: Thirdly, the orderly carriage that ſhould be between officers, and members: each of them keeping their place, and unto each other performing the duty of their relation: and it is this laſt on which I ſhall ſpeak of at this time.</p>
               <p>You are met here at this time for the election of a <hi>Paſtor;</hi> for no man is to take upon himſelf an office in the Church, but one that is ſet apart by God thereunto: and the way by which God doth ſet men apart for this office, is, by the election of the people: whoſe power
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:115739:64"/> or whoſe priviledge it is to chooſe their own officers that ſhall be over them: as appears in that inſtance of the Deacons the loweſt officers, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.5. they <hi>chuſe</hi> them, and the <hi>Apoſtles ordain them</hi> unto the office; and when the people chuſe thoſe perſons that are qualified according unto the rules preſcribed in the word, then they may conclude theſe are the <hi>officers that God hath ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> over us:</hi> and <hi>the Holy-Ghoſt hath made us over ſeers,</hi> and the officers are to take it as a call from God, unto the employment: and being choſen, it is not to be looked upon as a humane, but as a divine inſtitution, and he that is choſen is to be looked upon as an officer unto Chriſt: and to have his power from Chriſt, according to the rules of the word, over that people: It is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary therefore in ſo weighty a buſineſs, that you ſhould know the grounds upon which you go: and what the office is unto which you are now to elect a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: and what the <hi>Order</hi> is which the Lord hath ſet down to be obſerved between the <hi>Paſtor</hi> and the <hi>people:</hi> that ſo you may know what to expect from him in way of duty: and what he in a way of duty is to expect from you; that ſo the <hi>order</hi> of God between both may be obſerved.</p>
               <p>Firſt, what is the office of a Paſtor? The office of a Paſtor is an Inſtitution of Chriſt: all that rule in the Church do rule under Chriſt, and therefore they muſt have their office from him; it is not for men to make a new officer in the Church any more then it is for them to make new ordinances in the Church; as all offices in a State are appointed by the ſupreme power, and there is no man is to take an office upon him that they do not authorize: ſo alſo it is with the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. <hi>he hath ſet over them in the Church. Eph.</hi> 4.11. <hi>he gave
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:115739:64"/> gifts to men:</hi> that is, the office, and the gifts that did qualifie for the office: officers that are ſet in the Church are of two ſorts: ſome temporary, as <hi>Apoſiles, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> and <hi>Evangeliſts:</hi> and their gifts were but for a time: the gifts did ceaſe with the office: but there are ſome officers that are ſtanding, and are to continue in the Church until the end of the world: for there is <hi>a work of the miniſtery</hi> that muſt continue <hi>till we all come to the unity of the faith, for the gathering and the perfecting of the Saints;</hi> till we all come to the unity of the faith: that is, till all the Saints of God that are ſcattered abroad all the world over, be gathered together to the unity of the faith: that is, if they be converted, and do all believe: For there is but one faith which all the Elect of God muſt have, and till that be begun and their ſanctification be perfected, till they all do become <hi>a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect man,</hi> and attain <hi>to the fulneſs of the ſtature of Chriſt,</hi> that he hath himſelf appointed them in this life to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to before they be tranſlated to glory; therefore ſuch officers in the Church Chriſt hath inſtituted, and and he will continue them till the end of the world: ſo long as there are any Saints to be gathered, or graces in them to be perfected.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the election of a <hi>Paſtor</hi> is the priviledge of the people; and in that the will of Chriſt is made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, and the call of Chriſt is to both the perſon cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, and the people: its given them by Chriſt, and they are thankfully to accept it, and carefully to improve it, and preſerve it, and not ſuffer them to be taken from them; the Saints of God are to look upon priviledges to be ſaved as well as promiſes, and they muſt not part with any of them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the <hi>Apoſtles, Acts</hi> 6.5. that had the higheſt
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:115739:65"/> authority under Chriſt, yet they did not take upon them to impoſe any officers upon the Churches, but <hi>they muſt look them out,</hi> and <hi>they muſt chooſe them,</hi> then the Apoſtles will ordain them; and ſurely they that would not impoſe a <hi>Deacon,</hi> which is the meaneſt officer, they will not impoſe any higher officer: and it is the rule that the Apoſtle gives, 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 3.10. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, they muſt be <hi>proved</hi> firſt: and alſo approved by the people: for the word ſignifies both to try a thing, and upon tryal to approve it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the ordering all things in a Church ſtate doth plainly argue it: for every thing there is done by mutual conſent; and there can be no union in the <hi>body,</hi> but by their own conſent; for as conſent doth unite us unto Chriſt, ſo it doth alſo amongſt our ſelves: for in all things, as it is in the Church inviſible, faith and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in Truth makes a man a member of the Church inviſible; ſo the profeſſion of that faith and holineſs makes a man a member of the viſible Church: conſent of the heart makes a man a member of the Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible; and this conſent profeſſed makes a man a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Church viſible: and as it is between the members, ſo alſo it is between members and officers: for all power is of three ſorts: either it is natural, or voluntary, or tyrannical: now all Church power can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be natural; and it muſt not be tyrannical; therefore it muſt be voluntary, and by the conſent of parties; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Do not ye Judge thoſe that are within, ſays the Apoſtle?</hi> therefore they that were within came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this power of judgement, becauſe they had given conſent unto that power to live under it, and to be ruled by it: whereas they that were without, and did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to it, they were not ſubject to it, or bound by it.</p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:115739:65"/>
               <p>Thirdly, from this election of the people, there doth ariſe a voluntary relation between the Paſtor and the people, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. <hi>The Elders of Epheſus came to</hi> Paul, <hi>and he commands them to take heed unto themſelves, and to all the flock over which the holy Ghoſt hath made you over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers:</hi> and <hi>Col.</hi> 4.12. it is ſaid of <hi>Epaphras,</hi> that <hi>he is one of you:</hi> for he was Paſtor of the Church of <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> and ſo, <hi>the Angels of the ſeven Churches:</hi> there were ſome general officers over all the Churches as the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were, and ſo were <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> and thoſe that planted Churches: but there are particular Church-officers that have a relation to ſuch a people by vertue of their election, and their own acceptation: and they ſtand in the relation of an officer unto that people only, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to none other; ſo that though by vertue of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from Chriſt they preach as the miniſters of the Goſpel unto any people; yet by vertue of the election of the people they have the relation of <hi>Paſtors</hi> to none but thoſe that choſe them ſo to be.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the office of a Paſtor is to be reduced to two heads: Firſt the duties that he doth owe to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Secondly, the diſpoſitions with which thoſe duties are to be performed.</p>
               <p>Firſt the duties that he doth owe to the people, and which he is by vertue of his calling bound to perform; and theſe duties are,</p>
               <p>Firſt he is bound to inſtruct them: <hi>Chriſt is the great Shephard of the Sheep;</hi> they are but Shepherds under him: <hi>Chriſt feeds the flock,</hi> and ſo they muſt do: <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.15. the promiſe is, <hi>I will give them Paſtors after my own heart, that ſhall feed them with knowledge and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> therefore, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2. <hi>He that is a Paſtor, he muſt be able and apt to teach:</hi> he that is not able to feed a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:115739:66"/> with knowledge and underſtanding, he is not quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for this office; feeding you know is a conſtant and a daily thing; he muſt ſupply them with new food from day to day, <hi>bring out of his Treaſury things new and old,</hi> Mat. 13.52.</p>
               <p>Firſt he muſt be one that hath a <hi>Treaſurie,</hi> a ſtock to ſpend upon, that will not be ſpent or drawn dry. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly he muſt have all ſorts of knowledge, <hi>things new and old:</hi> what ever may be either profitable, or taking to the people, he muſt be furniſhed with: it is an allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>Par.</hi> obſerves of new and old wine: ſome are taken with old wine, and ſome deſire new; and ſome ſay, Give us both new and old: that is the knowledge of the Law, and of the Goſpel; or elſe it may be their meaning in new notions, and old experiences, and he muſt bring them forth alſo for the people (ſilk worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like) weave it out of themſelves continually.</p>
               <p>And the Paſtors duty in point of teaching is reduced to three heads.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it is the duty of the Paſtor to catechize them, and inſtruct them in <hi>principles,</hi> in <hi>the foundations of the Doctrine of Chriſt; they that are unskilful in the word of righteouſneſs muſt have milk,</hi> Heb. 5.13. and ſo the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors office is ſet forth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.6. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>he that is catechized in the word:</hi> and ſo he is to take care of the weak ones in the Church, and of the children of the Church-members, that they be inſtructed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">Secondly, he is to <hi>lead them to perfection: Heb.</hi> 6.1. for their care muſt <hi>be to build them up</hi> further, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.32. not that they ſhould ſtand at a ſtay in knowledge, but <hi>grow in knowledge,</hi> that <hi>the whole connſel of God</hi> may be known to them, and the <hi>word of God may dwell richly
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:115739:66"/> in them;</hi> their knowledge praiſed, and thereby their graces improved; for the Paſtors are debters unto <hi>men for meat, as well as unto babes for milk.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, they are to <hi>convince the gain-ſayers, Tit.</hi> 1.9. that if there be corrupt tenents, and wicked Doctrines vented, the Paſtor ſhould take care to ſtrengthen, and ſtabliſh the people againſt them, <hi>that they may not be as children carried away with every wind of Doctrine,</hi> Eph. 4.14. <hi>For it is whileſt men ſlept,</hi> through the careleſneſs and negligence of the Paſtors it is, that <hi>the enemies</hi> have ſuch power and opportunity of <hi>ſowing tares,</hi> as they have, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.30. <hi>he bids them watch againſt the Wolves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, he is to pray for the people, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.9. <hi>God is my witneſs, that I make mention of you alwaies in my prayers: Col.</hi> 1.3. <hi>praying alwaies for you:</hi> and in this, though <hi>Paul</hi> was an extraordinary officer; yet he is a ſtandard and an example for our duty; we are to pray for the people; and to do all that doth belong to them to do for the Church; and here conſider three things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, they are to acquaint themſelves with the ſtate of the flocks, that ſo they may know their particular neceſsities and wants, that they may go to God for them for ſutable ſupplies: he that is a Shepherd, muſt know the ſtate of his flock.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they are to pray for them not only <hi>ex charitate ut fratres,</hi> but, <hi>ex officio:</hi> the brethren are to pray for one another as brethren, it is their duty; but the Paſtors they are to do it as men in office, and as thoſe that God hath appointed, and hath inſtituted unto that work: and therefore they may expect to be anſwered for them, in what ever petition they put up to God:
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:115739:67"/> they may look for a gracious return of their prayers; as we ſee under the Law it was enjoyned, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.17. <hi>Let the Prieſts, the Miniſters of the Lord weep between the Porch and the Altar, and let them ſay, Spare thy people O Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they muſt pray for particular perſons ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their neceſſities, and engage their intereſt unto God for them: <hi>James</hi> 5. <hi>Is any ſick amongſt you? let them call for the Elders of the Church, and let them pray,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Labouring</hi> to keep the Judgement off from the body of any particular member of it; if any man be ſick, the <hi>Elders of the Church may pray over him, and they ſhall ſave the ſick,</hi> and labour to attain the pardon of the ſins that occaſioned the ſickneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, he muſt watch over them, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. <hi>Take heed of all the flock;</hi> not in a careleſs and a formal man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; for the <hi>Lord ſays, Son of man, I have made thee a VVatch-man, and thou ſhalt watch over this people,</hi> Ezech. <hi>For I will require their blood at thy hands;</hi> But how muſt he watch over them? Firſt he muſt obſerve diligently that they be not corrupted in Doctrine, and <hi>he muſt contend carneſtly for the faith,</hi> that they be not turned away from the Truths of the Goſpel. Secondly, he muſt watch over them that they be not defiled in their converſations, that there do no root of bitterneſs ſpring up amongſt them, that he neither <hi>ſuffer</hi> the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Nicolaitans,</hi> or <hi>the woman Jezebel:</hi> one by Doctrine, and the other by practiſe, to corrupt the Church.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he is to obſerve and watch that their graces do not decay: and that they do not <hi>fall from their firſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ve;</hi> but he is to quicken them in duty, and ſtir them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> from day to day, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12.11. <hi>He is to faſten the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:115739:67"/> goads and nails given by one Shepherd.</hi> Fourthly, if any be ſick he is to viſit them; the <hi>Elders of the Church are to be ſent to them.</hi> Fifthly, if any of them be offended, or miſ-led he is to labour to reduce them; <hi>the wandering ſheep he is to bring home upon his ſhoulders;</hi> if any be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſtray, he ſhall ſeek that ſheep and bring him back again to the fold. Sixthly, if any be weak he is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them; <hi>he is to bear the Lambs in his boſom,</hi> to mourn with them, and have compaſſion over them: and this he is to do not only for ſome of the great ones, but he is to do it impartially over all the flock: For God makes no difference in reſpect of any mans title, or place, but he that hath the beſt heart, is the beſt man in Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and in Church members thoſe ſhould be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by us, that have the greateſt graces, not the greateſt places.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it is the Paſtors duty, if any man in the Church <hi>walk diſorderly or inordinately,</hi> he is to mourn for them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.17. <hi>My ſoul ſhall weep in ſecret for your pride:</hi> and <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Now I tell you weeping,</hi> &amp;c. Their miſcarriage ſhould be to him as the errors of a child unto a tender Father; he ſhould bewail them with bitterneſs; to conſider how they thereby go about to deſtroy themſelves, ſhould exceedingly affect the Paſtor; as Chriſt when <hi>he beheld Ieruſalems ſins he wept over it;</hi> and many times there is nothing left for a miniſter to do for a perſon but to ſhed tears.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he is to <hi>admoniſh them,</hi> and that authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Know them which labour amongſt you, and are over you, and admoniſh you in the Lord</hi> (that is) by vertue of the authority that is commited unto me by Chriſt, I do admoniſh you in the Lord: and this is to do a thing in <hi>the name of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:115739:68"/> 
                  <hi>Yea reprove them ſharply:</hi> and ſo <hi>Paul</hi> doth propoſe it unto the <hi>Corinthians, Whither he ſhould come to them with the rod or in the ſpirit of meckneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, if nothing elſe will do, they muſt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Church, in which they are, have the main hand, they are to ſtir them up to caſt out ſuch a perſon, and to repreſent it to the Church according to the power that is committed unto them by Chriſt for the Churches edification, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.3. they muſt not bear them that be evil, they muſt be caſt out; they ſhould look upon it as their Burthen, that any amongſt them ſhould deſerve to be caſt out from the Church, yet they muſt do their duty: this is the <hi>rule that they have over you in the Lord, Heb.</hi> 13.17.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, they muſt walk as examples to the flock, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.3. <hi>Go before them in a holy life;</hi> 2 <hi>John</hi> 10. it is ſaid, <hi>Chriſt is the Shepherd, and he goes before the ſheep, and his ſheep do follow him;</hi> the meaning is, he went before them in a holy converſation; for he <hi>hath in all things given us an example:</hi> a Copy to write after, that we ſhould walk as he hath walked; Paſtors ſhould be a living Scripture, and walking Bibles, more then any other men; and yet ye are to take this as a rule, <hi>be you followers of us, as we are of Chriſt: and mark them who ſo walketh as they have us for an example, Philip.</hi> 3.17.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for the diſpoſitions with which all theſe duties are to be done, which I will lay down in ſix par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, from a tender love and care; God doth put this care of the flock unto thoſe whom he calls to be their Over-ſeers in mercy, and he doth give them graces ſutable, Paſtors graces, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.16. God did
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:115739:68"/> put the ſame care into the heart of <hi>Titus, Phil.</hi> 2.26. <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> that was their Paſtor, he doth long for them exceedingly, and his love was ſo great, that he would not have them ſo much as grieved, and therefore he was ſorry that they had heard that he had been ſick: there was in the heart of our Lord Chriſt a Law of love written; <hi>thy Law is in the middle of my bowels;</hi> as there ſhould be a love amongſt the members, ſo in a ſpecial manner in thoſe that are Paſtors and Fathers to a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, their <hi>bowels ſhould yern over them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, all this is to be done with the ſpirit of meekneſs; in a way of Miniſtry, and not in a way of Majeſty: <hi>For we are but your ſervants for Chriſts ſake: and we are not to rule as Lords over Gods heritage,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.3. and therefore pride, and imperiouſneſs, muſt be avoided; for all that we have to do is by the word, and we can rule no other way.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, all things muſt be done without ſelf-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, and to make a gain of the people; we <hi>muſt feed the flock not for filthy lucres ſake;</hi> that though <hi>the Paſtor is to eat of the milk of the flocks</hi> and though it be the peoples duty: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.14. <hi>God hath ordained that they ſhould:</hi> yet this is not to be the end propounded by the Miniſter or Paſtor unto themſelves: for them to have ſuch a low end as this, <hi>put me into the Prieſts office, that I may eat a piece of bread;</hi> no we are to ſeek you, and not yours: <hi>and to expect our crown of glory, at the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the great Shepherd of the ſheep,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.9.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it muſt be with faith: and an expectation that God will in a ſpecial manner bleſs their endeavours and labours unto that people over which God hath put them: <hi>over which the holy Ghoſt hath made them over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers:</hi> for with the call of God there doth go the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:115739:69"/> bleſſing of God: and if God do put a man into any office, he may expect a bleſſing upon him in that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment: he doth call Chriſt, and he doth promiſe him, <hi>the pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand:</hi> and Chriſt ſends forth the Apoſtles, and he promiſes to <hi>be with them to the end of the world Math.</hi> 28.19. the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are to expect a greater bleſſing by them becauſe God hath put them over them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. <hi>they watch for your ſouls:</hi> So the Miniſters alſo that go forth with faith to preach the Goſpel, the Lord will make them a bleſſing to the people where he ſends them.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, it muſt be done <hi>as thoſe that give an account for your ſouls,</hi> that are the people committed to his care, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. there are great accounts that men have to give for talents, and opportunities of doing good; and of Riches that God hath entruſted them with, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and the day of grace: but the greateſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is that of ſouls, which are precious unto all thoſe to whom their own ſouls are precious: and as the Lord Jeſus himſelf comes in at the laſt day before the Father, <hi>Here am I and the children that thou haſt given me, Heb.</hi> 2.13. So alſo this will be the work of the Miniſtry at the laſt day, <hi>they will give an account of your ſouls:</hi> O what a great thing is it for a Miniſter to be able to ſay, <hi>I pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſuch a ſoul:</hi> I inſtructed ſuch a ſoul; he was blind before, and God uſed me as an Inſtrument to convey light to him: I watched over ſuch a ſoul; for it is your ſouls only that we have to do with all: and its only with reference to your ſouls that we watch over you.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, the Paſtors of a people do their duty, as thoſe whoſe crown of glory it will be at the laſt day, for us to deliver our flock well into the hands of the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:115739:69"/> great Shepherd at the laſt day that he hath betruſted them with, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.19.20. <hi>This is our glory and Crown of rejoycing: yea in the preſence of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt at his coming,</hi> &amp;c. to ſee their graces thrive, their ſouls proſper, Chriſt gloried in it, <hi>he ſees the Travel of his ſoul and is ſatisfied:</hi> and it is a great ſatisfaction unto poor Miniſters in this particular alſo; and having given their charge ſafe into the hands of Chriſt, they ſhall then lay down the burden of their office, and they and their flock ſhall be made happy together; and though the particular relation ſhall ceaſe between them, yet ſhall they take more ſpecial comfort and communion one with another as Saints in glory for ever: their relation that they had to each other here, will ſweeten their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hereafter.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Now to make up this <hi>Order of the Goſpel,</hi> alſo there is a duty that the Members do owe unto their Paſtors that are in this manner choſen by them: and they are theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it is the peoples duty to pray for them, as thoſe that God ſets in authority over them: if your Paſtor prays for you as being over you, you ſhould alſo pray for him as being over you.</p>
               <p>Firſt, pray for their gifts and abilities, to go through their duty the whole compaſs of it. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.10. <hi>and for me, ſaies the Apoſtle, that utterance may be given unto me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, for their preſervation. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.30. <hi>That you ſtrive together in prayers, that I may be delivered from them that do not believe in</hi> Judea.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, pray that they may have a ſanctified uſe of all their afflictions, and of all Gods diſpenſations, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.19. <hi>I know that this alſo ſhall turn to my ſalvation through your prayers:</hi> when the prayers of Paſtor and people meet
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:115739:70"/> together at the Throne of grace each for other, it is exceeding acceptable to God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, honour them in your hearts; let it be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the honour Chriſt hath given them in the Congregation, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.13. <hi>Know them and eſteem them highly in love for their works ſake:</hi> they are to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves <hi>as your ſervants;</hi> and to look upon you as <hi>the Lords heritage,</hi> and that they are not Lords of the flock: they are not to know in that reſpect their own honour, as <hi>Moſes his face did ſhine;</hi> it was ſeen of others, but not of himſelf: but yet there is an honour that is due from you unto them alſo.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſubmit unto them, or be perſwaded by them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. <hi>Attend upon their miniſtrie, as thoſe from whom you may expect a ſpecial bleſsing;</hi> though it may be they may not have ſuch great parts and gifts as others, yet they are thoſe that God hath ſet over you; and do you ſubmit to them: though they be in outward reſpects far inferiour unto you, yet as they are Paſtors, ſo they ſtand in Chriſts ſtead; for remember they are ſo by an Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; and ſo diſobedience unto them ſpeaking in the name of Chriſt, is a diſobedience unto Chriſt; <hi>he that hears you, hears me; and he that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me;</hi> it is a very dangerous thing for a people to have their Miniſter go to God againſt them, and bewail the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt that is put upon them, and ſay, <hi>Lord, thou haſt ſent me to a rebellious and gain ſaying people:</hi> Chriſt ſays to ſuch a one, <hi>Thou ſhalt kick the duſt of thy feet againſt them; it will be eaſier for</hi> Sodom, <hi>then it will be for that man in the day of Judgement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, encourage his labours: ſtrengthen his hands: ſtand by him, look upon your ſelves as concerned in all things that befall him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.26. <hi>Epaphroditus was ſick,</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:115739:70"/> and they were very ſenſible of it, though he were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from them; and he was willing to venture his life for the Churches ſervice; and indeed the labour is bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſom, and continual; do what you may to make it eaſie to him, that he may undergo it with cheerfulneſs; <hi>For if he give up his account with grief, it will be unprofit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for you,</hi> Heb. 13.17. So if he do his work with grief alſo, it will be as unprofitable to you, as uncomfortable to him.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, admoniſh him of what evil ſo ever you ſee in him; if he do not walk with a right foot towards the Goſpel: or be negligent in the performing of his office: <hi>ſay to him, Take heed to thy Miniſtry, Col.</hi> 4.17. It were a miſery for the greateſt officer to be exempted from that ordinance of admonition, which is a mercy to the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt member: and yet be careful, do not take up every flying report againſt him: for there are no men ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the ſcourge of the Tongue as they are: but <hi>God as he will wipe all tears from their eyes,</hi> will alſo wipe off all blots from their name.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, there is a ſupply which you are to make to their wants, and it is your duty <hi>to adminiſter unto them of your ſubſtance,</hi> according to your ability, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.6. You muſt make him partaker of all good things: Firſt you muſt do it in obedience as an Ordinance of God. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it muſt be given proportionably to a mans abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, for it muſt be in all good things. Thirdly, not to think much of what you give them: if the miniſters <hi>of the Goſpel ſow ſpiritual things, why ſhould we count it a great matter if we let them reap of our carnal things?</hi> theſe things which are the truths that the Goſpel holds forth, as the Lord hath enabled me, I have endeavoured to give every one their portion, both Paſtor and people:
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:115739:71"/> what remains further in relation to both, as God gives opportunity I ſhall by his aſſiſtance ſet before you: I ſhall now beg your prayers that the Lord would teach me how to go in and out before you, that ſo I may be given you in mercy and not in Judgement.</p>

                  <hi>Tabernacle of God amongſt men,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4,5,6. There are three things that are by the Lord exceedingly differenced in the Church: firſt there are <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, <hi>all have not the ſame gifts,</hi> but the Lord <hi>divideth</hi> them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as he will Secondly, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, there are diverſities of Offices: all the members in a Church have not one and the ſame office, or miniſtery, or labour. Thirdly, there are <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, different effects of thoſe offices and gifts: men labour in them with a different fruit and ſucceſs: Some more, and ſome leſs, according as the Lord is pleaſed to uſe them or bleſs them: and as ſuitable to the Churches neceſsities; ſo <hi>he doth give gifts,</hi> ſo he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:115739:72"/> to <hi>the pattern</hi> in the one as well as the other: for what ever is not of the Lords appointment, that he will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther own, nor bleſs; it is of ſuch that Chriſt ſpeaks of in <hi>Ioh, Every plant that my Heavenly Father hath not plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhall be rooted up:</hi> it is thoſe that did place themſelves in Offices in the Church, never planted by the Father. Here are in the words two things. Firſt the Officers du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that is, firſt to <hi>rule,</hi> and then to <hi>watch.</hi> Secondly, the object or ſubject of this authority, it is not over the bodies and eſtates of men, but <hi>their ſouls only.</hi> Thirdly, the great engagement and obligation that lies upon them ſo to do, becauſe <hi>they muſt give an account.</hi> Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, here are the different accounts that Church Officers will give to God, and that is ſome <hi>with joy,</hi> and ſome <hi>with grief.</hi> Secondly, here is the duty of the people that are under their power. Firſt, they are to <hi>obey.</hi> Secondly, to <hi>ſubmit themſelves.</hi> Thirdly, upon this ground, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>they are ſuch as watch for their ſouls, and muſt give an account.</hi> Fourthly, as knowing <hi>if it be with grief, it will be unprofitable unto them.</hi> And hence there are ſeveral propoſitions very uſeful to our preſent occaſion, which I will ſet down in their order. <hi>Firſt, that the Lord Chriſt as head of the Church, hath appointed that there ſhall be Officers in all the Churches:</hi> there is as well an Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Officers and offices, as there is of Ordinances; and it is in a mans power to conſtitute the one no more then he may the other: and the neglect of one, is a neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of the Inſtitution, and ſo of the authority of Chriſt, as well as the other; it will appear that there hath gone ſome great hands unto this, and to manifeſt this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.</p>
               <p>Firſt Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11. it is counted there as one of his <hi>gifts,</hi> which <hi>Chriſt gave</hi> upon his Aſcenſion: for he
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:115739:73"/> doth not only ſay that he gave the gifts that qualified men for that work; and that is a mercy when the Church is enriched with gifts, and the Lord doth pour out his ſpirit upon many of them, that they be fitted for office if they be called to it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.7. 2. in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth though there be but a few Magiſtrates, yet there be many that are fitted to be Magiſtrates: as in an Army when the ſouldiers are valiant, yet its not expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient that every one is able to command a party, or be an Officer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But it is not the gifts only, but the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers alſo that Chriſt hath given his Church, and they are to be looked upon as a ſpecial gift of Chriſt, as a ſpecial fruit of his taking poſſeſſion of the Kingdom, when <hi>he ſat down at his Fathers right hand;</hi> and though they were all given <hi>for the gathering and the perfecting of the Saints,</hi> yet ſome were but temporary, others were to abide to the end of the world, till all the Saints were gathered and perfected; and therefore it is ſaid that <hi>he hath ſet them in his Church,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the word notes a conſtitution, a firm ſtabliſhment, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be changed, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. <hi>the times and ſeaſons which the Father hath put in his own power,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, by a firm ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment and decree, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ</hi> 5.9. <hi>God hath not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed us to wrath, but to attain ſalvation:</hi> its the ſame word. So that the word ſignifies to appoint by a firm and a ſure decree, which cannot be changed; <hi>he hath ſet them there,</hi> and therefore none ſhall or can remove them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Holy-Ghoſt he alſo hath a hand in this Conſtitution, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. <hi>Over whom the Holy-Ghoſt hath made you over-ſeers;</hi> it is ſpoken unto Officers when they meet with the Apoſtles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and for the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of it, we muſt conſider, <q rend="inline">That the Spirit is the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:115739:73"/> Mediatory Kingdom hath undertaken to be as it were a <hi>Prorex,</hi> to rule for Chriſt: therefore, <hi>before the Throne there are ſeven Lamps of fire, that is, the ſeven ſpirits of God, Rev.</hi> 4.5.</q> for in the gifts and graces the Spirit is given, the Goſpel its Preached <hi>by the Holy-Ghoſt ſent down from heaven,</hi> &amp;c. Now there are two things main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the Holy-Ghoſt doth in this conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Spirit doth gift the men, and qualifie them for the work; <hi>for though there be diverſity of gifts, yet it is the ſame ſpirit that works in every man even as he will: to one man the gifts of wiſdom, to another the word of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but by the ſame ſpirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7,8,9,11. that as before <hi>Bezaleel</hi> and <hi>Aholiab</hi> did ſet upon the work of the Tabernacle, he was <hi>filled with all wiſdom</hi> by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, <hi>underſtanding and knowledge in all manner of work-man-ſhip:</hi> and when <hi>Saul</hi> was called unto the Kingdom, <hi>the ſpirit of the Lord came upon him, and he was turned into another man,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. Whether we do look unto the providential, or ſpiritual Kingdom, it is now in the hands of the Spirit, and he knowing what works he hath to accompliſh in both, he doth gift men for the work in which he will employ them: for though the gifts be common, yet they proceed from the ſpirit as well as graces.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when a man is gifted, and by the furniture of the man there is a ground to conceive God hath done it that he may employ him, yet it is not enough by and by for any man to ſay, I am gifted, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will employ my ſelf; but there is another work of the ſpirit, and that is, he doth ſtir up the hearts of men, to chuſe men, &amp; to call them forth unto the works whom he hath gifted, and qualified for it: and this draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:115739:74"/> out of the ſpirits of men, in that way that the Lord would have them, is a ſpecial work of the ſpirit of God, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.26. God having gifted <hi>Saul,</hi> he doth draw out the ſpirits of men to call him to the office of a King, and to joyn with him in it, <hi>whoſe heart God had touched;</hi> and the finger of God, is the ſpirit of God, by whom the hearts of men are touched: and therefore <hi>Zach.</hi> 4.6,7. <hi>Not by power and might, but by my Spirit,</hi> that is, his ſpirit that is working upon the ſpirits of men, both in inſtruments, and oppoſites, raiſing and elevating the one, and ſubduing the other: ſo that the ſpirit inclining and ordering, and over-ruling of the hearts of men in ſuch a work, it is an evident teſtimony of a call from the ſpirit; for <hi>their hearts God had touched,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, there is yet ſomething more, and that is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons being thus choſen, there is a ſanction, and a ſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Holy-Ghoſt, that doth come upon them: that as all the duties of the office lie upon their conſciences, by the command of God, that whatſoever is required in that office, the Lord expects it of them; ſo all the honour and dignity of the office is due to them, and that by a command from the Holy Ghoſt: and <hi>men are to be ſubject for conſcience ſake,</hi> as an act of obedience unto God; as a wowan before ſhe hath choſe a husband is at liberty to marry whom ſhe will, only <hi>in the Lord;</hi> but having once choſen a husband, all the duties that belong to a husband, ſhe is to perform unto him, by vertue of the Covenant of God, and in obedience unto God: and as it is with a people in the point of the Magiſtracy, its true that civil government is appointed by God; but that it ſhall be in this or in that form, he hath not appointed: and therefore though there be ſeveral forms of government, yet all are lawful,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:115739:74"/> and may according to the rules of prudence be made uſe of in any ſtate, as ſhall be moſt for the publike good: therefore all forms of civil government are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. He did conſtitute them in that particular place where they ſhould be.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, for this cauſe the Apoſtles they took ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al care to ſet up all the Inſtitutions of Chriſt, as well offices as ordinances: as the ſtate and condition of the Church did require, and therefore they did not only gather them into bodies, but they did alſo ſet Officers over them: <hi>Acts</hi> 2.14,23. <hi>They ordained Elders in every Church,</hi> and the ſame charge and employment they gave to the Evangeliſts, who were appointed to this purpoſe, to <hi>confirm the Churches, and to ordain Officers in every Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, and we ſee that all the Churches of Chriſt accepted of Officers, and acknowledged them as ſuch; as <hi>there were Elders in the Church of Epheſus, Acts</hi> 20.28. and the <hi>Church of Jeruſalem had not only Apoſtles but El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders alſo, Acts</hi> 15.2,22 and therefore the whole Church is brought under theſe two heads, <hi>them that rule over you, and all the Saints, Heb.</hi> 13.24. They are not all Rulers, all are not men in office, there be Rulers that are diſtinguiſhed from Saints.</p>
               <p>To what end are officers appointed in the Church? what need is there of them? they are appointed by

                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:115739:76"/> Chriſt for theſe ends: Firſt <hi>for the Churches perfection,</hi> in the Conſtitution thereof: for though a Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out officers be a true Church in reſpect of the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of it, when there is a ſociety of viſible Saints, united into one body by mutual conſent, in the profeſſion of the faith of the Goſpel, as appears <hi>Acts</hi> 6. there was a <hi>Church at Ieruſalem,</hi> before there were Deacons: and a <hi>Church at Antioch,</hi> before there were Elders, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.23. but yet it is nor a compleat Church in all the parts of it, as an <hi>Organical</hi> body: therefore it hath officers <hi>ſuperadded,</hi> and therefore as ſoon as the Apoſtle had converted a people to the faith, firſt they did embody them, and then for their perfection they ſet officers over them: they did not look upon them as compleat, whileſt <hi>they were as ſheep without a Shepherd:</hi> till there be ſome to rule, and to order them in the waies of a Church, and according to the Inſtitutions of Chriſt: and therefore in all ages the officers have been in a ſpecial manner the glory of the Churches, as the Apoſtles were, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Upon their heads is a Crown of twelve ſtars:</hi> and therefore <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.8. <hi>We have a little Siſter, and ſhe hath no breaſts,</hi> that is a ſtabliſhed miniſtery, and ſettled officers, from whom <hi>the ſincere milk of the word</hi> might be ſucked: <hi>breaſts of conſolation,</hi> whereby they might be ſupported: Now this tends to the perfection of a Church, as we ſee it deſcribed, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.7,8. <hi>Thy breaſts were faſhioned, and thy hair was grown:</hi> it notes coming unto maturity, and ripeneſs of age: whereas a Church wanting officers, is but a little ſiſter yet in her infancy or minori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Officers are appointed in the Church, <hi>to avoid confuſion;</hi> therefore the Lord ſaw officers to be neceſſary, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.33. <hi>God is not the author of Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:115739:76"/> but of Peace, in all the Churches of the Saints:</hi> and <hi>Col.</hi> 1.2.5. <hi>rejoycing and beholding your order,</hi> according unto Gods order, when every man keeps his place, and rank: that is, they that rule keep their place, and they that are to be ſubject keep their place: for the Greek word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is a military term: and if either of theſe be wanting, there will be confuſion in the Church: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he will have ſome to rule, and others to obey, that there may be no diſorder: and by this means no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences: for its diſorder that is the ground of all diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, as it is order that is the ground of peace: break order in a Church, and you break the peace of it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Lord doth it <hi>for the Churches edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> that as <hi>he doth give diverſity of gifts, and all of them to profit withal,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. It is not that any of them ſhould lie idle, and be uſed barely for a mans ſelf, and his own advantage, as an ornament to himſelf, but for the good of the Church; ſo the Lord doth alſo appoint <hi>diverſities of adminiſtrations</hi> to officers in the Church, that according unto mens gifts, ſo they may have ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able employments in the Church, in which they may encreaſe their gifts, and thereby having publike occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they may be more publickly uſeful, then otherwiſe ever their gifts could have been, had they continued on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as private Chriſtians: therefore the Lord having gift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, and thereby fitted them for the publike good, he doth give unto them a call unto a publick office, that thereby they may have opportunity to exerciſe theſe gifts, that he hath given them: which elſe in a private condition muſt needs in a great meaſure lie idle, the man wanting opportunity to draw them forth as in an office he may do, and thereby improve them:
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:115739:77"/> ſo then officers there are by the appointment of Chriſt, and we may not neglect them leaſt we deſpiſe any inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and leaſt we run into confuſion, and be enemies to our own perfection and edification; and therefore it is a great fault in ſome Chriſtians that they are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them; ſometimes they are without a <hi>Preaching Officer,</hi> ſometimes they are without <hi>Ruling Officers,</hi> and all upon ſome curioſities: they cannot have a man ſo qualified as they deſire, a man that hath eminent gifts, or a great name, an honourable repute: there is a great deal of pride and vanity that men do manifeſt even in ſuch things as theſe are, that are ſpiritual pride: as men glory in officers, <hi>in Paul, in Apollo,</hi> &amp;c. They are ſaid to be <hi>puffed up one againſt another,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. that is, they were puffed up for their Teachers, and they grow proud, and boaſt, one againſt another, becauſe we have higher and more eminent officers then you: therefore they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe one another, and ſo they were in their boaſtings and glorying <hi>carnal:</hi> there is a great deal of pride and vanity in mens glorying in them carnally, when they have them; and its manifeſted in many, that becauſe their pride this way cannot be ſatisfied, therefore they will chuſe rather to be without them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Theſe officers have an office: there is an employment, and a power which is put into their hands by Chriſt, for the good of the Church: we read in Scripture of <hi>the power of the keyes, Math.</hi> 16.18. which is an Enſin of Authority, put for the Authority it ſelf: as to give a man a ſword, is to put the power, of the ſword into his hand: to commit authority to him, of which this is the Enſign: and ſo it notes a Commiſſion given by Chriſt, unto ſome perſons to rule in his houſe, according to the order, and the rules preſcribed
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:115739:77"/> in the word: and this power in Scripture is three-fold: Firſt it is Monarchical in reſpect of Chriſt the head: Secondly, it is Democratical in reſpect of the body of believers. Thirdly, Ariſtocratical in reſpect of the officers: So Dr. <hi>Whitaker,</hi> p. 2. pag. 519. there is a threefold power that belongs unto the members of a Church; firſt a power of <hi>admiſsion of members,</hi> and of ejection of them: therefore the people are taxed, that <hi>they did not caſt out the man;</hi> there is a <hi>virtus expulſiva</hi> belongs to the body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.13. <hi>Take away from amongſt you that wicked perſon:</hi> and the ſame is the Judgement of <hi>Peter Martyr, loc. com.</hi> p. 886. ſect. 9, 10. where he doth peremptorily deny, <hi>Abſque Eccleſiae conſenſu quem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piam excommunicari poſſe,</hi> &amp;c. and if ſo, <hi>ejuſdem poteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> the ſame power that can caſt out, they only can admit; for if the officers may admit without the body, they may caſt out without them alſo. Secondly, there is <hi>a power of Election,</hi> they have a power given them by Chriſt to chuſe their own Officers, that the Apoſtles would not interpoſe, but <hi>Acts</hi> 6. the Church do chuſe their Deacons, <hi>chuſe out amongſt your ſelves.</hi> Thirdly, there is <hi>a power alſo of admonition,</hi> Math. 18.15. <hi>Take two or three with thee and admoniſh them;</hi> and it is an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative act, for it is in a way of proceſs, after a private admonition hath been refuſed; and if there were not ſuch a power given unto the Church, then, Firſt if Officers abuſe their power, they have no remedy againſt them, they muſt lie under it for ever; the Church ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving power to withdraw from any particular man, may alſo do the ſame to an Officer. Secondly, then that Officer is without any remedy himſelf, and he hath not the priviledge of the meaneſt member; for if excomu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication be an Ordinance, and is for edification, and to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:115739:78"/> reclaim, if an officer go aſtray and perſevere in it, it is a miſery to be deprived of it; but yet there is a power and authority that belongs to the Officers, which muſt not be intrenched upon by the Community; as to preach the word, adminiſter the ſeals, obſerve the waies of the Church, to viſit the ſick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe are the acts of the Elders, which the whole Congregation are not to meddle withal: and though it is true that a private Chriſtian may watch over his brother, and viſit the ſick, they are to do it, yet he doth it not as an act of office, but of brotherly love and Chriſtianity only: and there is a great deal of difference: as it is one thing for a man to give an alms, and another thing as a Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, <hi>to communicate to the Neceſsities of the Saints, as every one hath need;</hi> the Church may chuſe the Deacon, but they cannot execute the office of a Deacon: they muſt not give all of them their own alms, becauſe it is not the way into which Chriſt hath put it: there is a great deal of difference between theſe two, as it will appear in this; we pray one for another <hi>ex charitate ut fratres, non ex officio ut mediatores:</hi> out of Love, not out of office. It is very different to do the ſame thing as a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and as an officer: theſe two powers muſt be kept diſtinct, that as the Church muſt not meddle with the authority and power of the officers, ſo neither muſt the officers ingroſs and take to themſelves the whole power of the Church; for in the primitive times it was not ſo.</p>
               <p>Now theſe Officers have a power committed to them; they are as the Churches ſervants, and ſo they are to acknowledge themſelves: <hi>VVe preach our ſelves your ſervants for Chriſts ſake:</hi> and they are to manage it with all humility: therefore <hi>not as Lords over Gods heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,</hi>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:115739:78"/> for all is for the good of the Church, and ſo <hi>the Angels are miniſtring Spirits,</hi> becauſe it is for the good of the Church, though the greateſt power and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty under Chriſt, is committed unto them, in ordering of all things here below: but yet there is an authority committed unto them by Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.8. there is an <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, an authority given them, <hi>for edification of the body,</hi> &amp;c. though to keep in, and caſt out, belong to the body, yet they have a ſpecial hand in it, and the manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all the buſineſs of the body belongs to them wholly, and therefore the names that they have, do note a great deal of power, and great authority, they are not only called <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in this place, and <hi>v.</hi> 7. they are <hi>your Guides, Leaders and Commanders:</hi> and therefore,—it is taken from the Maſter or Pilot in a Ship, that turns it about to ſteer it in its right courſe, and therefore they were of old called <hi>The Maſters of Aſſemblies, Eccl.</hi> 12. and this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears ſo much the greater, if you do conſider alſo that they ſpeak to you in the name of Chriſt: for 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.12. <hi>They are over you in the Lord;</hi> and what they do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire by vertue of their office, they can do it in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; as an Embaſſador hath great power becauſe he ſpeaks in the name of the King: and they can enjoyn you as you owe obedience to Chriſt, in whoſe name we ſpeak, and whoſe work we do: therfore <hi>he that rejecteth you rejecteth me,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4. <hi>In the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt deliver ſuch a
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:115739:79"/> man to Satan:</hi> if they did it in their own name, there were little power in it indeed, but in the name of Chriſt there is great authority: and there is this the more to be added, becauſe as it is a power given them by Chriſt, and Chriſt is deſpiſed in them, ſo it is a power given them by your own conſent: now for a man to give conſent to put power into a mans hand, and afterwards he denyes him the exerciſe of that power which he hath given him, it is for a man to <hi>Judge and condemn himſelf in the thing which he himſelf allows:</hi> therefore it layes a neceſſity upon you of ſubjection to this power, both <hi>for conſcience ſake,</hi> and as a thing that was done by your own free election and conſent: and ſo there is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an authority that commands it, but a <hi>Law of love al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo:</hi> as a woman ſubjects her ſelf to her husband, not only as God hath commanded it, and given him autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over her, but alſo from a principle of love, becauſe this is the man that I did chuſe to my ſelf to obey, and to be ſubject unto all my dayes: therefore a double Law is broken in this reſpect: and this ſtill argues the greatneſs of an Officers power in the Church: Its cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the power of the keyes,</hi> which doth note a very great authority and office; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22.22. power in the houſe, the ordering of governing of all the affairs in a family, ſhall go through their hands: as it is ſaid of <hi>Joſeph, what ever was done in all the land of Egypt, he was the doer of it;</hi> ſo it is true of them, what ever is done in the Church of God, it muſt go through their hands, they muſt alſo be the doers of it: and <hi>Math.</hi> 16.19. it is <hi>the keyes of the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> which is meant both of grace, and glory, <hi>a power to bind and looſe in the Church,</hi> by vertue of the Inſtitution of Chriſt and what they do bind and looſe, or they remit or retain, ſhall be ſo done in the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:115739:79"/> world to come, in the Kingdom of Heaven: ſo that they ſhall open Heaven to the Church, and if they ſhut them out, heaven ſhall be ſhut out: if they binde upon their conſciences, ſo will the Lord alſo in the world to come in Heaven: and in this reſpect, it is a far greater power, then if a man had the keyes of the authority and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of all the Kingdoms of the Earth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>the ſubjects of this authority,</hi> it is not the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, lives of men, or their eſtates, but the authority is ſpiritual, and it relates unto the ſoul only and this will appear: Firſt becauſe it is managed only by ſpiritual means: as <hi>the Kingdom of Chriſt is not of this world,</hi> the management of things in the Church of Chriſt are not to be done in the way of the world; it is not by any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward power and greatneſs, or by authority and force of arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but all is ordered by the word, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5. <hi>The weapons of our warfare are mighty through God;</hi> for it is this that is the Scepter of the power of Chriſt, and all the authority that he doth exerciſe by his Miniſters, and Officers under him, it is by the word only; and <hi>if they wil not hear</hi> the word, <hi>let ſuch a man be unto thee a Heathen man, let him be Anathema Maranatha to the coming of the Lord:</hi> we muſt leave him as a man incurable: we can do no more to him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.22. if the word will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim him, we have no way to deal with him, but to ſet before him <hi>the Judgement that is written,</hi> which if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe, then Church-Officers have no more to do, but as they when they refuſed the Goſpel, did <hi>ſhake off the duſt of their feet: it will be eaſier for</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah <hi>in the day of Judgement:</hi> they have no power either to impriſon, or afflict their bodies, or ſeiſe upon their eſtates, if they obey not: they can only leave men to the Judgement of the Lord. Secondly, anſwerable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:115739:80"/> the power, ſuch are the cenſures, and they are all ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, they relate unto the ſoul: they can inflict no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral puniſhment upon men, but the Puniſhment in Scripture, and firſt <hi>a binding of their ſins, Joh.</hi> 20.21. as they pardon ſin in the conſcience and in regard of their Church-ſtate by receiving them after ſinning upon their repentance; So there is a binding of ſin upon the conſcience, convincing a man of the guilt of ſin, and alſo the putting him out of the ſociety, ſo that the mans ſin is bound in his own conſcience, and before the Church, and the Lord ſaith, <hi>It ſhall be bound in heaven,</hi> and ſhall not be pardoned to him; or if he be godly, he ſhall not have the ſenſe of pardon till by this ordinance of Chriſt he be again received.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>they withdraw communion with him,</hi> 2 Theſ. 3.14. <hi>If any man obey not our word, note that man, and have no fellowſhip with him, that he may be aſhamed;</hi> all this is in reference to the ſoul, that the man may be reclaimed; it is only, Mingle not with him, that when he ſhall ſee all godly men to avoid him as a Peſt, and his communion as ſome filthyneſs, he may thereby take ſhame to himſelf.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>deliver him to Satan,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4,5. Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances are means to inflict ſpiritual Judgements, as well as to convey ſpiritual Bleſſings: caſt him out by a Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial act from the Aſſemblies of the Saints; and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing caſt out, he is in the world where Satan rules: he ſhall have nothing to do with Ordinances more; and yet all this is with ſpecial reſpect unto his ſoul: it is <hi>for the deſtruction of the fleſh, that the ſoul may be ſaved in the day of the Lord;</hi> therefore all power is for the good of the ſoul, that is committed to the Officers of the Church.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, all their power is <hi>for ſpiritual ends,</hi> all with
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:115739:80"/> relation to the ſoul: Firſt, <hi>for preſervation,</hi> they do <hi>watch over them,</hi> that they be not deceived with corrupt Doctrines, <hi>leſt being led away with the error of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they ſhould fall from their ſtedfaſtneſs;</hi> and becauſe <hi>VVolves will come in, watch therefore, take heed to your ſelves and to all the flock, Act.</hi> 20.30. and alſo leſt they be corrupted in their practiſes, for <hi>a little leaven will lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a whole lump,</hi> therefore <hi>Church Officers</hi> are made <hi>watch-men</hi> to diſcover the danger that is coming upon them, and to prevent it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for <hi>their edification,</hi> therefore S <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>The power was given for edification;</hi> that he had autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the Church, it was that he might have the greater opportunity to edifie the Church of God: and 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.12. <hi>They labour amongſt you, and admoniſh and inſtruct you: all is for the edification of the body of Chriſt, till we all come to the unity of the faith, and to a perfect man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>for their ſalvation;</hi> all is done, <hi>that the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit may be ſaved in the day of the Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5. and therefore the great care of all the Officers mentioned in Scripture, hath been of the ſouls of men, and to ſee <hi>their ſouls proſper,</hi> and their graces thrive; how ever it was with them in outward things, if they were <hi>rich in faith,</hi> and <hi>abounding in hope,</hi> and <hi>full of good works,</hi> though it went never ſo mean with them in outward things, they were not afflicted with it; and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> is mightily troubled when <hi>they are turned away from the Truths of the Goſpel,</hi> and when any of them do walk ſcandalouſly, to the endangering of the ſouls of the reſt of the body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Officers muſt give an account of ſouls that are committed unto them:</hi> Here firſt, every man muſt
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:115739:81"/> give an account to God for his own ſoul, and his own waies, for <hi>we muſt all appear before the Judgement ſeat of Chriſt,</hi> to this end, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. Secondly, every man ſhall give an account of the ſouls of others, ſo far as either they have been under his power, or he hath had a hand or been inſtrumental in their deſtruction: as the deſtruction of Iſrael will be charged upon <hi>Ieroboham, who made Iſrael to ſin:</hi> and <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.17 <hi>Thou ſhalt not bear ſin for him. Ab alienis meis,</hi>

                  <hi>Auſtin:</hi> and it is a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible thing to be Inſtrumental in any mans deſtruction. Thirdly, but Officers in a ſpecial manner, that do take the charge of ſouls, they ſhall give an account for them, that is, according to the terms of the Prophet, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.17,18. <hi>If thou give him warning, he ſhall dye in his ſin: the blood ſhall be upon his own head, thou haſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered thy own ſoul: but if thou do not give him warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he doth periſh, but his blood ſhall be charged upon thee, it ſhall be required at thy hands:</hi> it is the guilt of blood that is the greateſt guilt, and of all bloods, the blood of ſouls; yet this is that which lyes upon you, which <hi>Eraſmus</hi> ſaith, <note place="margin">Eraſmus.</note> are <hi>fulmina non verba;</hi> its a terrible thing to conſider ſuch a charge upon him with ſuch a danger: A man that conſiders what account he hath to give of his own ſins, he would not be willing to take upon him alſo the guilt of other mens ſins, and give account for them. Fourthly, all that are imployed by God, there will come a time when they muſt come unto God, and deliver up their charge for the talents that they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; <hi>I had five Talents,</hi> here they are, and are impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to five more: the unprofitable ſervant muſt come alſo, that <hi>hid his Talent in a Napkin,</hi> and conſcience ſhall give up its charge, when it layes down its viatory office, delivering the man up perfectly unto the grace
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:115739:81"/> of God; and Chriſt <hi>the Kingdom</hi> (which ſome (as <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>) do underſtand of the Church of the Saints, and that fitly, and truly) <hi>unto the Father: I have kept them through thy name:</hi> take them now to thy ſelf, <hi>that they may be with me where I am;</hi> and ſo for a man to lie down in the duſt with this account, and to appear before God with this truth, <hi>Of all the ſouls that thou haſt given me,</hi> this is my account, that <hi>I have brought them unto thee ſafe: here am I and the children thou haſt given me:</hi> Fifthly, of all truſts in the world, that of ſouls is the greateſt: Firſt, it is the great thing in the man, and the man is loſt when his ſoul is loſt: and therefore in one place it is ſaid <hi>looſe thy ſoul,</hi> and in another <hi>looſe thy ſelf;</hi> it is eternal deſtruction, when the ſoul is loſt; it is more worth then a world: <hi>it will not profit a man to gain the world if he looſe his ſoul.</hi> Secondly, it is the great thing that Chriſt betruſts us with, he doth prize it above all things elſe; all other <hi>Talents</hi> that he gives us are but for the good of the ſoul; and it was in love to the ſoul, that Chriſt did, and ſuffered all that he did for poor loſt man; it was meerly <hi>for the redemption of his ſoul,</hi> the great thing that Chriſt hath an eye to is the <hi>ſoul,</hi> the which he hath moſt glory, and about which he hath laid out moſt grace. Thirdly, it is that which Satan doth moſt of all oppoſe, and deſire to deſtroy: he is indeed <hi>Abadon,</hi> he hates all man-kind, but his chief aim is at the ſoul; <hi>he is a murtherer,</hi> but he will murther the ſoul if he can: that is it which he doth charge all his volleys at, he cares not for mens eſtates and for their honours, it is their ſouls that is the great thing in his eye, therefore there is nothing is in ſo much danger, and there is no ſuch truſt committed unto a man as the ſouls of men; it is a greater truſt then to have the charge of all the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:115739:82"/> Kingdoms of the world. Sixthly, ſurely then they had need know the ſouls well that are under their charge, they had need of a very exact account of them, and to keep an account of them, that ſhall give this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count before Chriſt at the laſt day; and therefore all that are heedleſs in this office, and that for low and poor ends undertake ſuch a charge, and are negligent, and are wanting in that labour and diligence in it, it doth plainly argue, that men do judge the account of ſouls to be but a ſmall thing, and that which may be eaſily paſſed over; and truly as he that hath no care of his own ſoul, will never take care of an others, ſo he that makes no matter of giving up an account to Chriſt of his own ſoul, it is no wonder if it be a ſmall thing to him if he had the burden of all other mens ſouls upon him alſo: but he to whom the account of his own ſoul is dreadful, he that hath known the terror of the Lord in himſelf, it is a terrible thing unto him to give an account of other mens ſouls alſo. Fifthly, there is <hi>a different account</hi> that Officers will give at the laſt day, ſome will give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>with joy,</hi> and ſome <hi>with grief:</hi> there is a double connexion. Firſt, <hi>they watch for your ſouls,</hi> obey that they may do their work with comfort, watch for your ſouls with comfort. Secondly, that <hi>they may give up their account with joy;</hi> for the obedience of a people is a ground of both; the greateſt joy of a faithful Miniſter of God is in this, which was the great ſatisfaction of Chriſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10. <hi>To ſee the Travel of his ſoul:</hi> the joy of harveſt is the greateſt joy; one ſows and another reaps; to receive the fruit of a mans labour, is as it were reaping it brings great joy, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Now we live if you ſtand faſt;</hi> the great comfort of our lives comes in by it; for it is a comfortable living to ſee the ſouls of
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:115739:82"/> men committed to our charge proſper, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Ye are our glory and joy, our Crown of rejoycing in the preſence of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, at his coming;</hi> ye are our glory and joy; next unto a mans intereſt in Chriſt, and the joy that he hath at his appearance, are the ſouls that he hath brought unto him: on the contrary what they do, if the people profit not, they do it, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                  <hi>ſuſpiran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes:</hi> its true, that there ſhall be no ſorrow of the Saints at the laſt day: for there ſhall be no more ſighing; ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>tears ſhall be all wiped away,</hi> but yet there will be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that will be even matter of ſorrow to them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that they have loſt their labour, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.45. <hi>I have laboured in vain,</hi> and the labour of the officers is great, it is the greateſt labour, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.12. it is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, weariſom cutting labour, and to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all this as loſt in reference to the main end of it, is a grievous thing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that the ſouls of the people are loſt, which was the greateſt care, that they ſhould <hi>dye in their ſins,</hi> though their <hi>blood be not required a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> their hands;</hi> Oh it is ſad: for there is a great love in the Officers that are faithful unto the ſouls of the people: and they ought to walk in a high degree of love towards them; now to ſee thoſe ſouls loſt for whom I put up ſo many prayers, and about whom I took ſo much pains; it is <hi>grieving the Spirit of God to ſee men turn his grace into wantonneſs, Eph.</hi> 4.30. And it will alſo exceedingly grieve them that are acted by the ſame Spirit.</p>
               <p>Thirdly that I ſhould be inſtrumental in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, and be a means to heighten it: for <hi>it will be caſier for</hi> Sodom <hi>in that day;</hi> and the greater means men have had, the greater will their condemnation be; the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:115739:83"/> greater pains any Miniſter hath taken with a people, the greater will their Judgement be; <hi>they that have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted up to heaven, ſhall be brought down to Hell,</hi> and in <hi>the day</hi> of <hi>Revelation, when the ſecrets of God as well as the hearts of men ſhall be made manifeſt,</hi> it ſhall appear how Ordinances did ripen ſins, and how God did make uſe of them to pour out ſpiritual Judgements by them: the greateſt <hi>curſes come out of Sion,</hi> as well as the greateſt bleſſings.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that I ſhould be brought in as a witneſs againſt them at the laſt day: <hi>Satan ſhall be the accuſer;</hi> but there will be three very dreadful witneſſes againſt them. Firſt, <hi>Chriſt: then ſhall the King ſay,</hi> &amp;c. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Conſcience:</hi> a mans own thoughts will accuſe him <hi>in the day that God ſhall judge the ſecrets of men.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the <hi>Miniſters,</hi> when they that have been labouring for their good all their life time, ſhall witneſs againſt them. <hi>There is one that accuſeth you, even</hi> Moſes <hi>in whom you truſt;</hi> when a man ſhall bring in his accuſation againſt a diſobedient and <hi>a rebellious people, Mark</hi> 6.11. <hi>Shake off the duſt of your feet for a teſtimony againſt them; it will be eaſier for</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah, <hi>then for them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, From all that hath been opened we may plainly by way of uſe gather, what manner of men Church-Officers ought to be: Firſt, <hi>they muſt be gifted:</hi> and it is this muſt be the ground of the Churches choice: for as grace fits a man for communion with God, ſo do gifts fit a man for the edification of the Church: and who ever is choſen that is not gifted, was never appointed by Chriſt; for the Holy-Ghoſt doth gift men, before he doth ſet them over any people: therefore you are not to look only at the grace, but at
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:115739:83"/> the giſts of Officers: every godly man is not fit for an office. Secondly, <hi>they muſt be humble men:</hi> for they have a power put into their hands, and an honour put upon them: now it will be a ſnare to a proud man to be in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and he will never uſe power well that is not hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: the great care of officers ſhould be that they might ſo walk as <hi>not to Lord it over Gods heritage:</hi> they muſt not exerciſe a Lord-like authority, but carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in all manner of meekneſs and humility, or elſe it is dangerous to put ſuch a ſnare upon them: it is a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation for them to be in place. Thirdly, they muſt alſo be <hi>holy men,</hi> ſuch as have a care of their own ſouls, and rightly judge of the price of a ſoul; for they that have no care of their own ſouls, will never have a care of yours. Fourthly, they muſt be <hi>faithful men,</hi> that is faithful in labour: Laying out themſelves to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt without any reſpect to themſelves, or to their own eaſe: for the buſineſs which they are to do, concerns ſouls, and they muſt <hi>be faithful in their account,</hi> thoſe that ſhall do all things that their office requires of them upon this conſideration, that <hi>we muſt give an account for the ſouls that are committed to us:</hi> it is not an account un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church that will ſerve, but our account muſt be <hi>unto him that ſhall Iudge quick and dead.</hi> Fifthly, he muſt be a man <hi>eminent in holineſs,</hi> for he muſt be a <hi>Leader:</hi> Now there are many Saints that are not fit to lead: their Officers are to walk holily before them, that they may follow their example; and he muſt alſo be coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, or elſe he will never dare venture in dangers, to go before them, and if he be not ſo, he will be a man apt to miſ-lead and pervert; there is nothing more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous then to have a man of great parts and eminent place in the Church, if he be a leader in an evil way:
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:115739:84"/> men will be ready to follow him: and therefore above all take heed of this, that he be a man eminent in holineſs and of an exemplary converſation. Sixthly, that he <hi>be well known</hi> and acquainted with you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if he have not all theſe qualifications, ſee the evil of it in theſe particulars; I wil but name them. Firſt, you abuſe a Goſpel-priviledge, a power of Election that is put into your hands. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in the end you will find the miſery of it by putting your ſelves into the power of men, who ſhall not uſe their power for your edification, but for their own honour and advantage, making Church-power to ſerve their pride and luſts, which hath been the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon abuſe of it in all ages of the Church.</p>

               <p>In this <hi>Pſalm</hi> you ſhall find <hi>David</hi> lie under a great affliction, and a great temptation: an affliction, for he ſaith, that <hi>he was plagued every day, and chaſtened every morning:</hi> and the temptation roſe from his obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the contrary proſperity of the wicked. Here was a diſpenſation of Providence that <hi>David</hi> could notunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand;
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:115739:85"/> here was a Temptation of Satan, that <hi>David</hi> could not overcome; thereupon <hi>he goes into the Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God.</hi> Truly, whatſoever men may think, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyeſt men, and the ableſt men will ſometimes ſtand in need of the Miniſtry of the word: <hi>David</hi> went into the Sanctuary of God, and then the paſſage of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence was clear to him, his mind was quiet, there is a pacifying vertue in the word, and the temptation vaniſhed: and this the Lord did by diſcovering unto <hi>David</hi> the ground of this differencing diſpenſations in outward things, in regard of the different Covenants under which men ſtand; and that both towards unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate men, and towards his own people: Towards unregenerate men, the Lord in his Sanctuary did diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to <hi>David</hi> theſe Three things;</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, their outward proſperity was but like a dream, but an Image, an appearance an outſide, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp; doth pleaſe men no longer then while they are aſleep: it was but as a dream, when a man waketh, that all their outward proſperity would certainly die.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Lord diſcovered to him, all this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhould end in their utter deſtruction in time; and that this <hi>Jordan</hi> of content did but carry them down to the dead Sea; the Lord will ſay, they had <hi>their portion in this life: Son, remember that in thy life time thou hadſt thy good things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the third place; the Lord diſcovered to him, that this common love ſhould end in an eternal hatred: ſo in theſe outward mercies there was a judgement: <hi>their Table was made a ſnare,</hi> and to ripen their ſins, and by this means highten their judgement; and ſo all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of the wicked to be an act of wrath, and not of mercy; and the Lord did advance them, that they
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:115739:86"/> ſtand upon ſlippery places. In all Gods diſpenſations towards unregenerate men there is a judgement, even in thoſe things that are mercies: outward bleſſings in themſelves, but curſes to the men; becauſe this is a rule, <hi>Sine ſummo bono nil bonum:</hi> there is nothing good to a man that hath not an intereſt in God that is the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt good. Theſe things being diſcovered unto <hi>David,</hi> he underſtood the end of theſe men; but in the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary alſo God taught <hi>David</hi> ſomething of his own people; and they were theſe three things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that notwithſtanding their ſufferings. yet they had Gods preſence in them: though the Lord be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with his people at all times, yet eſpecially in the worſt times: when the Buſh is in the fire, then in an eſpecial manner is <hi>the good pleaſure of him that dwels in the Buſh</hi> there: <hi>Thou art with me</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>thou holdeſt me with thy right hand.</hi> And as he had Gods preſence: So he learned in the Sanctuary, that they had Gods guidance: as he did not bear the affliction alone by his own power, ſo he did not go through it with his own wiſdom: <hi>thou ſhalt guide me with thy counſel.</hi> And,</p>
               <p>Laſtly, he had Gods glory; <hi>for theſe light afflictions work for us a more exceeding exceſsive eternal weight of glory: thou ſhalt guide me with thy counſel, and afterwards receive me to glory:</hi> and this <hi>ſowing in tears</hi> ſhall make way for a joyful harveſt. Now <hi>David</hi> having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood theſe things in the Sanctuary, hence he begins again to lay claim to God, and that he had made the beſt choice. <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee? and who do I deſire upon earth in compariſon of thee? ſurely it is good for me to draw neer to God.</hi> Thus Gods people are gainers by all their afflictions, and they grow the ſtronger
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:115739:86"/> by all their temptations: This being the Connection, The Obſervation then that I ſhall deſire to handle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any diviſion of the words, is plainly in the Text.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>In the handling of this truth, there are two things that I ſhall deſire to clear for Explication, and then we ſhall come to Application.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I deſire to ſhew you what it is for a man to draw neer to God; by ſin every man he is departed from God; the firſt deſign of ſin is to draw a man away, 1 <hi>Iam.</hi> 14. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and the further a man goes in a way of ſinning, the further he doth depart from God. <hi>Inde</hi> 18. and all the luſtings of their heart <hi>are ungodly luſts.</hi> In this reſpect it is ſaid, <hi>the Prodigal went into a far Country. Eph.</hi> 2.17. Now there is by reaſon of ſin a double diſtance of enmity and eſtrangement; The Apoſtle in <hi>Col.</hi> 1.21. puts them both together: <hi>VVe are ſtrangers and enemies in our minds through evil works:</hi> now anſwerable to this double diſtance, ſo muſt our returning to God be: there muſt be a returning by reconciliation to take away your enmity: and by Communion, to take away your eſtrangement: for Chriſts buſineſs is, <hi>to bring us back unto God again,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18</p>
                  <p>Firſt, for Reconciliation, that is not in Scripture cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>drawing neer</hi> ſo much as <hi>being made neer, Eph.</hi> 2.17. <hi>You are made neer that were a far off, by the blood of Chriſt:</hi> ſo that by Reconciliation a man is put into a ſtate of neerneſs and proquinquity. That is the firſt thing whereby the creature returns to God; but now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made neer, being put into a ſtate of union, then</p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:115739:87"/>
                  <p>Secondly, The ſoul comes to draw neer, that is, the eſtrangement muſt be removed, which is done by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, to exerciſe acts of communion; obſerve it I pray. I ſay a man muſt firſt be put into a ſtate of neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and made neer, before ever he can exerciſe acts of communion, and then draw neer. Now this drawing neer, is for a ſoul to come to God from day to day, to improve his intereſt in him, grow into more and more acquaintance and familiarity with him: and you ſhall find, that when a man is once brought into a ſtate of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then the Lord calls him alwaies unto fellowſhip. <hi>Open unto me my Love, my Siſter, and my Spouſe:</hi> there are continual knockings of the Lord as for a further entrance; there is a principle in us alwaies drawing back to perdition: and you ſhall find that there is a Spirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in alwaies calling to draw neer unto God: <hi>the Bride ſaith come, and the Spirit ſaith come:</hi> the Spirit in the Bride. There is a great deal of diſtance between God and the beſt of the Saints; for 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. while we are at home in the body, we are abſent from the Lord. So <hi>Ignatius</hi> of old, he ſaith, <hi>Aqua viva in me intrinſecus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit, veni ad Patrem:</hi> that there was a living voice with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him, that alwaies called upon him. And I beſeech you conſider, a ſoul that is once put into a ſtate of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and hath taſted what it is to draw neer to God, he deſires a daily communion, he is never neer enough, he doth continually ſet it as a ſeal upon the heart. When a man is once by reconciliation put into a ſtate of neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; then in all Ordinances, in all waies of obedience, in his exerciſe of all graces, the ſoul is ſaid to <hi>draw neer;</hi> that is, to act, and increaſe his fellowſhip and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God. This I conceive to be the meaning of that expreſſion, <hi>Ioh</hi> 22.21. <hi>Acquaint thy ſelf with God and be
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:115739:87"/> at peace, ſo goodneſs ſhall come unto thee:</hi> acquaint thy ſelf with him, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>aſſueſce te cum illo;</hi> it is in the Hebrew, and is rendred by ſome, <hi>accuſtom thy ſelf to be with him:</hi> a daily commerce with God, and an accuſtoming of a mans ſelf with fellowſhip and communion with him; this is properly to draw neer. So that as Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion taketh away your enmity, ſo communion takes away your eſtrangement.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay to me, Can a creature draw neer to God? if you look upon man in his natural diſtance, <hi>God is in heaven, you are upon earth:</hi> can there be a draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neer between finite and infinite? cna finite and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite have fellowſhip? nay, look upon man in his moral diſtance, as a ſinner, and ſo, <hi>can there be agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween light and darkneſs?</hi> can righteouſneſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs have fellowſhip? Surely, <hi>God is a conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire:</hi> and who can dwell, who can engage his heart to draw neer to him? Now give me leave (I beſeech you) to clear this to you, by propoſing to you this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>
                  <p>There is a two-fold ſtate of a ſinner. There are ſome ſinners that are in a ſtate of eſtrangement unto God: and whoſoever you be that are here preſent, the enmity of whoſe nature is not yet taken away, and deſtroyed by a work of Reconciliation: I ſay to you, whatſoever you be, you cannot draw neer to God: you may have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with duties, you may pray, you may hear, but you can never have fellowſhip with God in thoſe duties, and that upon a double ground.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe the enmity of your nature remains; and <hi>two cannot walk together unleſs they be agreed:</hi> and ſurely the neerer ſuch a ſoul comes to God in any duty where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Gods people approach to him, the more God is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:115739:88"/> againſt him, and the more he is eſtranged from him: a ſtrange expreſſion, that of the Prophet, <hi>I ſaw him in</hi> Gilgal, <hi>&amp; there I held my peace; Gilgal</hi> was the place of worſhip: the neerer any man comes, the more a mans heart riſeth againſt him, and the more enmity doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe: <hi>I ſaw him in</hi> Gilgal, <hi>and there I held my peace:</hi> you cannot draw neer to God, the enmity of your natures ſtill remains. You cannot draw neer to God alſo</p>
                  <p>Secondly, becauſe you have another ſociety: <hi>your fellowſhip is with unfruitful works of darkneſs;</hi> and the fellowſhip, the amity, and love of the world, is enmity unto God. I remember, <hi>Auguſtine</hi> complains concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf in the daies of his unregenerate condition, ſpeaking of the pride of the luſts of his Spirit: <hi>Ecce, hi ſunt amici quibus conſului, quibus credidi:</hi> theſe were the companions that I converſed with, theſe were my friends, and theſe were my Counſellors. Now, my Beloved, whoſoever he be that hath <hi>Communion with the unfruitful works of darkneſs,</hi> it is no wonder if that man cannot draw neer to God. I have told you already, and I deſire you would lay it to heart, you muſt <hi>be made neer,</hi> or elſe you can never <hi>draw neer:</hi> you muſt be in a ſtate of communion, or elſe you can never have fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with God. That is the firſt thing.</p>
                  <p>But there are a ſecond ſort of ſinners, that are <hi>made neer by the blood of Chriſt:</hi> and theſe, though God be in heaven, and they are upon earth: though they be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and the Lord be holineſs it ſelf: nay, though they in their own apprehenſions ſhall ſay as <hi>Hooper</hi> once did, <hi>Lord thou art Heaven, I am Hell:</hi> yet they may draw neer to him, and that upon theſe ſix grounds: I beſeech you obſerve them. A ſinner put into a ſtate of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion may upon theſe grounds draw neer to God.</p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:115739:88"/>
                  <p>The firſt is, Gods electing love: <hi>the Lord hath ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated unto himſelf the man that is Godly, Pſal.</hi> 4.3. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, it is in the Hebrew, he hath gloriouſly, and miraculouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wonderfully, ſeparated to himſelf into fellowſhip: not only to himſelf for ſervice, but to himſelf for communion: and what is the ground? becauſe you are <hi>predeſtinated unto followſhip,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. My Beloved, when you all fell from God as well as the Apoſtate An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, might not the Lord have left you in the ſame condition with them? and your doom ſhould have been <hi>curſed,</hi> and therefore curſed, becauſe you muſt <hi>depart;</hi> but if the Lord had been pleaſed to have been reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; if he had ſaid to you as <hi>David</hi> did concerning <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolom, bring the young man home, but let him returne to his own houſe, and let him never ſee my face:</hi> if the Lord ſhould have ſaid, I will not remember their evil againſt them to deſtroy them, but they ſhall never ſee my face more, they ſhall be eſtranged to me for ever: you would have ſaid, this had been a mercie, even your preſervation; but this doth not ſatisfie Electing love: there is a double end that electing-love aims at, 2 <hi>Luke</hi> 14. it is, <hi>peace and good will;</hi> not only <hi>Reconciliation,</hi> but <hi>Communion:</hi> that God may take the creature into fellowſhip with himſelf, and empty himſelf (as I may ſo ſpeak with reverence) into the boſom of the creature. Be pleaſed now to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, you may then <hi>draw neer to God</hi> upon this ground of Gods electing love.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, you may draw neer to God, grounded upon the nature of the Covenant of grace under which you ſtand. My Beloved, God deals with all mankind in a Covenant-way; and according unto the Covenant under which he ſtandeth, ſo are all Gods diſpenſations towards him: and to that end the Lord hath made a
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:115739:89"/> double Covenant with a double head. The firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was made with the <hi>firſt Adam,</hi> the ſecond Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with <hi>the ſecond Adam;</hi> and therefore God looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all mankind, as if there were but two men in the world. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.47. <hi>The firſt man was of the earth earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: the ſecond man is the Lord from Heaven Heavenly:</hi> God looks upon all mankind as coming under theſe two heads, <hi>the firſt Adam,</hi> and <hi>the ſecond Adam.</hi> Now the Covenant of grace which the Lord hath eſtabliſhed, it hath a double propertie. Firſt, it is <hi>faedus amicitiae,</hi> a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of friendſhip; the Lord doth take <hi>Abram</hi> as his friend. <hi>Abram my friend: James</hi> 2.23. Now the School-men tell us of two ſorts of relations; <hi>relatio diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiparantiae connotat dominium:</hi> that notes ſubjection and dominion, as between a King and a ſubject, a maſter and a ſervant; there is not ſo properly communion: and <hi>relatio aequiparantiae quae denotat Communionem:</hi> now the proper end of friendſhip, is fellowſhip: for a mans friend is as his own ſoul, and the Covenant of grace is a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of fellowſhip &amp; therefore they may draw neer unto him, being taken by God into a Covenant of friendſhip.</p>
                  <p>2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. the Covenant of grace is a matrimonial Covenant: <hi>faedus Conjugale: I betrothed her:</hi> in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.9. you knowin this is the neereſt Communion, &amp; the ſureſt oneneſs in this relation beyond al other in the world the greateſt friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip by vertue of an Ordinance two made one. One that was heretofore a ſtranger, ſhall be dearer then Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Mother, and this <hi>voluntary</hi> relation by conſent, ſhall by vertue of the Ordinance of God be more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werful then a <hi>natural relation, and a man ſhall leave Father and Mother, and cleave to his wife:</hi> and if there be this power in an Ordinance of God that is but civil, what efficacy ſhall divine Ordinances and this ſpiritual Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:115739:89"/> have? Surely, <hi>thou ſhall lie in his boſom,</hi> and have the more intimate and full communion with him for ever. Now when the Lord will ſet forth the neer Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion that his people may have with him by this Covenant this he calls a Matrimonial Covenant.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, you may draw neer to God grounded upon <hi>your union with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. that <hi>he that is joyned to the Lord, is one Spirit:</hi> and <hi>by that Spriit we have acceſs to the Father, Eph.</hi> 3.12. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the Apoſtle tells, that our way to God is <hi>through him;</hi> we have by Jeſus Chriſt our <hi>manuduction:</hi> he is the great Favourite that leads us in by the hand into the preſence of the Father, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.18. <hi>through him we have an entrance to the Father, by one Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> Chriſt is not only <hi>medium reconciliationis,</hi> but he is <hi>medium communionis</hi> alſo: by his ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the one; by his interceſſion the other: Jeſus Chriſt (my Beloved) hath a double refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to us: in the work of ſatisfaction, he is the means of Reconciliation: but in all our approaches unto God, being reconciled, Chriſt is the <hi>medium,</hi> he it is by whom we have Communion with the Lord. Beſides,</p>
                  <p>In the fourth place, you may draw neer to God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of your conformity to him: <hi>for we are made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the divine nature,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. and <hi>we live the life of God, Eph.</hi> 4.18. and <hi>we have his Image reſtored,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.49. Conformity is the ground of communion whereſoever it is. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.6. and the more Conformity, the more Communion we have: and when your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity ſhall be perfected, ſo ſhall your communion be. Take that place (and it is a choice Scripture) in that <hi>Zach.</hi> 3.7. <hi>If thou wilt obey my words, keep my charge, I will give thee places to walk in among thoſe that ſtand
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:115739:90"/> by;</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>inter ſtantes illos:</hi> who are theſe? Thoſe, interpreters conceive to be Angels: So <hi>Druſius, Poſt mortem anima tua in chorum recipietur,</hi> &amp;c. the Angels and the Saints they are taken into neereſt communion. So <hi>Calvin;</hi> ſo that the more Conformity there is, the more a man obeyeth God; and the more he keepeth Gods charges, the more the Lord will delight to <hi>give him places to walk in amongſt thoſe that ſtand by.</hi> Nay,</p>
                  <p>In the fifth place, you may draw neer to God; for though God be in Heaven you may aſcend, and the ſoul may be above in Heaven when the body is walking here below: there is a double way of the ſouls aſſent: either in <hi>contemplation,</hi> or <hi>affection.</hi> In contemplation, the ſoul may aſcend. <hi>John</hi> in <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. ſaid, <hi>I ſaw a door opened in Heaven, and a voice ſaid, Come up hither: John</hi> in his body aſcended not, but <hi>John</hi> in contemplation of his heart was above, <hi>Col.</hi> 3 4. A man is worth as much as his love is worth. <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> when he was in <hi>Babylon</hi> by the River <hi>Chebar,</hi> yet he ſaith, <hi>the Spirit of God carried him in the viſions of God to Ieruſalem, Ezek.</hi> 8.3. in his contemplation at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and yet notwithſtanding in his body in <hi>Babylon</hi> by the River <hi>Chebar:</hi> And the ſoul may aſcend in its affection; <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.21. <hi>Where a mans treaſure is, there will his heart be:</hi> and ſurely where a mans heart is, there is his happineſs: and where his happineſs is, there is the man; <hi>mira ſublimitate tranſit amor in ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum. Niremb.</hi> Obſerve it, <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith concerning himſelf, his ſoul aſcended up, and frequently ran and ſaluted the Prophets, and viſited the Patriarchs, <hi>&amp;c. Anima aſcendit frequenter &amp; currit familiariter per plateas coeleſtis Ieruſalem.</hi> Thus (my Beloved) may a mans ſoul be in heaven, even while his body is here below, <hi>feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:115739:90"/> upon the hidden manna,</hi> and bathing himſelf in thoſe rivers of <hi>pleaſures,</hi> that the Lord <hi>hath prepared at his right hand for thoſe that love him;</hi> then, though you be upon earth, you may aſcend, and therein draw nigh to God.</p>
                  <p>In the laſt place (I muſt haſten) you may draw neer to God; for if you cannot aſcend to God, God will be pleaſed to come down to you, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.15. <hi>Heaven is my Throne, I inhabit eternity, I dwell in the high and holy place, yet will I dwell with the humble and the contrite heart;</hi> Luk. 13.15. <hi>If the Prodigal do but ſay I will go to my Father;</hi> the loſt Son comes in, the compaſſionate father runs: God deals with his people in this, in a way of reatliation; and when a man hath but a motion to return to God, why the Lord is ready to meet him, and embrace him: he hath to this end appointed Ordinances, and in them he tells you, he will meet you, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.24. you need but come half way as it were; God ſaith, <hi>he will meet you.</hi> My Beloved, it is true indeed, it is an imperfect, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it is a real communion: we do but ſee him indeed <hi>behinde a wall; and through the lattice:</hi> but yet we do reaſly ſee. And it is ſuch a Communion that the Lord is himſelf exceedingly delighted with; <hi>the King is held in the Galleries;</hi> it is that mighty expreſſion of the Spirit, <hi>Cant</hi> 7.5. <hi>the King is held in the Galleries:</hi> there is a double Gallerie wherein Gods people take their walks with God, he, and they alone: the upper Gallerie is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for <hi>the ſouls of juſt men made perfect:</hi> but there is a lower Gallerie wherein Gods people walk with him here: Jeſus Chriſt is ſaid ſo to delight himſelf in this converſe, that <hi>he is held there,</hi> and that by nothing, but by the cords of love; <hi>The King is held in the Galleries.</hi> Thus then let this ſerve for the opening of the firſt
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:115739:91"/> Branch; what it is to draw neer to God; and upon what ground, though <hi>God be in Heaven and you upon earth:</hi> though <hi>God be a conſuming fire,</hi> and thou as a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but ſtubble before him, being put into a ſtate of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, thou mayeſt draw neer to him.</p>
                  <p>Now let us come to the ſecond Branch of the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Doctrine; and that is, why it is good for the people of God, yea beſt for them in calamitous times, then to draw neer, to keep a cloſe and a conſtant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him; truly the grounds of it are very weighty; take it in theſe particulars, as briefly as I am able.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, this is the only means to preſerve a man from the ſin of evil fellow-ſhip; therefore it is good to draw neer to God; you ſhall alwaies find times of ſuffering to be alſo great times of ſinning: and men in them, they are not <hi>Tam miſeri quam mali,</hi> as <hi>Salmon</hi> compares them. When God pours out his wrath, then doth Satan pour out his rage: then becauſe <hi>iniquity doth abound, the love of many waxeth cold,</hi> and men prove Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates and fall away. Now at ſuch times there is the greateſt Apoſtaſies, and backſlidings manifeſted then at any time: men fall from their former apprehenſions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to erroneous opinions: men fall from their former affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and they <hi>loſe their firſt love.</hi> Men fall from their former converſations, and they <hi>glory in their ſhame, and becauſe iniquity aboundeth, the love of many waxeth cold;</hi> and it is not ſtrange (I beſeech you mark it, for I ſpeak to you that fear God, that are put into a ſtate of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, I ſay it is not ſtrange) that even the Godly ſhould backſlide, and deny, and fall from the glory of their former converſation. <hi>David</hi> had <hi>his firſt and his lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter waies.</hi> It is the expreſſion in <hi>Chro.</hi> 17.3. <hi>Iehoſaphat
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:115739:91"/> walked according to the firſt waies of</hi> David <hi>his father.</hi> A <hi>David</hi> may have his firſt and his latter waies; and in ſuch times as theſe for a man not to fall from his ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſs (my Beloved) it is a mighty thing: <hi>when the Dragons tayl ſhall ſweep down the third part of the ſtars,</hi> for you to abide fixed; there hath been in all ages a courſe of the world: the world is a Sea, and every man is a drop emptied into that Sea, and he ſwimeth in it; he is apt to run with the tide: there is a <hi>courſe of the world, Eph.</hi> 2.2. and in every age of the world there is a ſeveral form of it: <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.4. <hi>delivered from the preſent evil world:</hi> that is the redemption of the Saints to be delivered from the evil world that is preſent, and that way of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that is common in their age, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ye ſhall obſerve this in the firſt three hundred years: then the generality of the world, they were <hi>the Dragons Angels that made war againſt the woman:</hi> but when <hi>the woman had brought forth a man-child, and he was advanced into the Throne of God,</hi> into the ſtate of the Empire, then preſently the world becomes Chriſtians. In <hi>Conſtantines</hi> time then <hi>Sathan pours out a flood after the woman,</hi> the flood of the <hi>Arrian</hi> hereſie, and then the world became an <hi>Arrian,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Jerom.</note> 
                     <hi>totus mundus factus eſt Arrianus,</hi> as <hi>Jerom</hi> complains. This flood being in ſome meaſure dried up, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſettled in the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> then <hi>all the world won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders after Rome: a new Beaſt ariſeth that had two horns like a Lamb, and ſpeaks like a Dragon,</hi> and reſerves all the cruelty of the Dragon, but only under a more promiſing, under a more harmleſs and promiſing ſhape; by and by, I ſay, all the world wonders after <hi>Rome.</hi> And thus you ſhall find <hi>men</hi> that <hi>mind</hi> nothing but <hi>earthly things,</hi> and that uſually that they may enjoy the world, they are thus carried on by the courſe of the world, in all
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:115739:92"/> ages; <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                     <hi>Iuſtin Mart.</hi> Now what ſhall preſerve us? Oh, there is nothing now but keeping cloſe to God, that will <hi>keep you unſpotted:</hi> In <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.9,10. <hi>Noah walked with God; ſemper incedebat, eratque cum Deo perinde ut homo cum homine amico,</hi>

                     <hi>Auſt.</hi> The Schoolmen put the queſtion how it comes to paſs, that the Angels and the ſouls of men in Heaven are impec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, and without ſin. They anſwer: that it is the Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical viſion, they have alwaies God in their eye: <hi>viſio Beatifica impotentes reddit ad peccandum:</hi> truly, there is nothing in the world that will ſtay the ſoul like to it. If you will be preſerved from the evil of the times, and be upright in a crooked generation, then take heed to walk cloſe with God. <hi>It is good for you to draw neer to God.</hi> But</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is good for you to draw neer to God, when all things elſe withdraw themſelves from you: My Beloved, it is good for a Chriſtian to make ſuch a ſuppoſition as the Prophet <hi>Habbakuck</hi> doth in <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.17,18. <hi>Though the Fig-tree ſhould notbloſſom, though there be no fruit in the Vine, though the labour of the Olive ſhould fail, and the fields ſhould yield no meat: the flocks ſhould be cut off from the folds, and the Herds from the ſtalls: yet I will rejoyce in the Lord, and I will triumph in the God of my ſalvation.</hi> Mark, he doth not only pitch upon thoſe comforts that are rather for complement then ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, but the choiceſt proviſion (as I may ſo ſpeak) of the worlds making; here is the Fig-tree, the Vine, the Olive, the Field, the flock: and he ſaith not, If any of theſe ſhould fail, then they might be recompenced with the labour of the other; but if all theſe ſhould fail to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and conſpire to make man miſerable: and not only to fail in hope, but even what you have already
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:115739:92"/> in poſſeſſion. When doth a man think his flocks to be certainer, then in his folds; and his herds, then in his ſtalls? but though the flocks, and the herds ſhould fail; what now will bear up his ſoul? <hi>I will rejoyce in God:</hi> Oh, it is time to keep cloſe to God; let me tell you, <hi>the Land reels to and fro like a Drunkard;</hi> ſometimes leanes this way, you know it, and ſometimes that way: truly, when the Land begins to ſink under a mans feet once, foundations ſhake, then it is time for a man to lift up his hands, and to take hold of heaven; <hi>reſtat iter coelo:</hi> for this will be the great cut to a mans heart when he ſhall be ſhut out of all things here below, as it was with <hi>Saul</hi> in his agonie: <hi>the Philiſtins made war againſt him, and God hides his head;</hi> the Philiſtines made war: ſo they did many times before, and <hi>Saul</hi> got the better; <hi>Saul</hi> had now an Army in the field.

                  <p>Thirdly, it is beſt, becauſe if you draw neer to God, God will certainly draw neer to you: he hath promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, in <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Draw neer to God, and he will draw neer to you:</hi> and the approach of God ſumms up all, <hi>Gen</hi> 15.1. <hi>for in his preſence is fulneſs of joy.</hi> It is a mighty expreſſion, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.7. that <hi>he that overcomes ſhall inherit all things.</hi> I, and that of our Savtour, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.30. <hi>If a man forſake father and mother, houſe or lands, he ſhall have a hundred fold more in this life:</hi> a hundred fold in ſome reſpect, he cannot have an hundred Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or an hundred Mothers, but Interpreters ſay, it is not to be underſtood <hi>formaliter,</hi> but <hi>eminenter:</hi> he
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:115739:93"/> ſhall have all the comforts in God that theſe could af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford him, if they were a hundred times more: Oh then draw neer to God, and God will certainly draw neer to you. But, I but name things.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, to draw neer to God is beſt; for by this means you ſhall be preſerved from the evil that other men ſuffer, the evil of ſuffering: The promiſe is in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.10. <hi>He that dwelleth under the ſhaddow of the moſt high; no plague ſhall come nigh him: he will give his Angels charge over thee;</hi> it notes a conſtant fellowſhip: thou ſhalt be the ſpecial charge that the Angels have I ſhall deſire you but to conſider, the Lord hath projects of providence for his peoples preſervation, as well as for his enemies deſtruction. <hi>Noah</hi> walked with God, and had an Ark, when the reſt of the world of ungodly men periſhed in the waters; <hi>David</hi> a man that kept conſtant communion, and we ſee how the Lord owns him in all his tryals and appears for him: <hi>upon all the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry there ſhall be a covering;</hi> and there are projects of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence beyond the wiſdom of men or Angels; for, <hi>the Lord knows how to deliver the juſt from all their trouble,</hi> and how to reſerve the wicked to the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Theſe things now I am forced to paſs over.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, (and ſo we will haſten to the Application) It is beſt for men to draw neer to God, becauſe a cloſe communion keeps up in a mans ſoul thoſe qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as ſhall make every afliction comfortable and eaſie, be the times never ſo bad: for the drawing neer of the ſoul to God, is like the Sun to the earth, which by its heat and perfect influence puts life, vigour, and beauty into things dead and withered before, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.12. Communion with God is the ſpring-time of all
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:115739:93"/> grace: and therefore I will but name them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Communion with God will keep a mans ſoul in a ſilent humble frame: that was the fruit of <hi>Aarons</hi> Communion in <hi>Levit.</hi> 10.3. a great croſs be fell him, he loſt two Sons taken away by an immediate act of Gods hand, even in an act of ſin; yet <hi>Aaron</hi> held his peace: <hi>Aaron held his peace:</hi> fellowſhip with God will certainly keep the ſoul in a peaceable ſubmiſſive frame, that be the affliction what it will be, the ſoul ſhall ſay, <hi>Gods will is the rule of goodneſs:</hi> when Judgement was pronounced againſt <hi>Hezekiah, good is the word of the Lord:</hi> and <hi>Iob, the Lord hath given, and the Lord hath taken away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, fellowſhip with God will keep a mans ſoul in a holy independency upon the things below: there is nothing (my Beloved) puts a mans ſoul out of band with the creature like communion: this is the way to have the <hi>Moon under your feet,</hi> as the expreſſion is: for that in fellowſhip with God, a man that knows what it is to have cloſe communion, knows that he doth really ſet his feet where other men ſet their hearts: it puts the mouth out of taſt to all creature comforts to him; <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <note place="margin">Chryſoſt.</note> though the world were on fire about his ears, yet he hath loſt nothing, for his portion is enough.</p>
                  <p>In the third place, as a holy independency, ſo a holy magnanimity of ſpirit; he ſhall not think thoſe things great that other men think inſupportable. <hi>Ieſus Chriſt endured the Croſs, and deſpiſed the ſhame;</hi> and the ſhame of the croſs was the greateſt ſuffering. Why do you weep and break my heart? <hi>I am ready not only to be bound, but to die for him.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luther.</note> And <hi>Luther</hi> (I remember) when the enemies gave out that he had recanted, he writes in a Letter of his, that I will never recant: think that I will
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:115739:94"/> do any thing rather then recant, be the dangers and threatnings what they will be; <hi>they are not careful to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thee in this matter: omnia de me praeſumes praeter fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gam, qui odium &amp; impetum totius orbis ſuſtinui:</hi> Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God keeps up a mans Spirit in this magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, fellowſhip with God keeps up a mans ſoul in a holy ſelf-ſufficiency: if it be in priſon, God is his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement; <hi>a good man is ſatisfied from himſelf, Solomon</hi> ſaith; ſo as he may enjoy God truly, he is able to ſtand upon the ruines of the world, and ſay, that he hath loſt nothing. <note place="margin">Auguſt.</note> I remember it is <hi>Auguſtines</hi> expreſſion of the Biſhop of <hi>Nola.</hi> The City was taken and ſacked by the <hi>Goths,</hi> that he did reaſon with himſelf, having loſt all his eſtate, ſhould he vex himſelf for the loſs of ſilver and gold? <hi>domine, ubi omnia mea tu ſcis.</hi> Lord, thou knoweſt where all my treaſure is laid up: there is a holy ſelf-ſufficiency in regard of a mans fellowſhip with God. Now this noble diſpoſition, communion with God will alwaies keep alive, and active in the ſoul. Let this ſerve for the Explication of the point. I ſhall borrow but a little time for application, I ſhall not hold you long.</p>

                  <p>I would make but one Uſe of it and no more. To exhort every one to put on <hi>Davids</hi> reſolutions in the times in which you live, <hi>It is good for me to draw neer to God:</hi> make it your buſineſs, to keep cloſe, and conſtant to him: truly, I fear many a man in publike employments (I beſeech you lay it to your own hearts, I ſay, I fear many a man) many a godly man in publike imployments his heart runs out ſo much upon the things without him, that he hath cauſe to complain as the Spouſe doth, the Church doth, <hi>they made me keeper of the Vine-yards, but
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:115739:94"/> my own Vine I have not kept.</hi> I am afraid, many in publike employments do much remit their private duties. My Beloved, there is a cloud that hangs over all the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Churches, and we have cauſe to fear, <hi>that the ſword is already bathed in their blood,</hi> &amp; that great a <hi>conſumption is determined upon them all,</hi> whether we conſider our ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſin, or our fearleſneſs of Judgement.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, fulneſs of ſin; for we have certainly, <hi>after pruning brought forth grapes of</hi> Sodom, <hi>and cluſters of</hi> Gomorrah: truly, I know whatſoever we may ſuppoſe of our ſelves, I know no terms that God offers to crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures but this: <hi>if you will not be chaſtiſed of me, I will puniſh you ſeven times more, and ſeven times more till I have deſtroyed you: in decretis ſapientum nulla eſt Litura:</hi> And if <hi>Gomer begins once to bear,</hi> in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1. (you ſee the pedigree of judgement) ſhe will never leave bearing till <hi>ſhe</hi> hath <hi>brought forth Loammi,</hi> perfect deſtruction: therefore if you look to the ful-neſs of ſin;</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If you look to the fulneſs of judgement: truly I may ſay, (though it be ſad to ſay it) <hi>Ephraim, England, is a ſilly Dove without a heart; gray haris are here and there, and ſhe knows it not.</hi> Conſider (I beſeech you) but the juncture of time into which God hath caſt us. The time of the <hi>Witneſſes prophecying in Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth and aſhes</hi> draws neer to an end, and they do think by and by to put of their Sack-cloth; and ſo ſome render that expreſſion, <hi>when they are about to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh their teſtimony:</hi> and they thought they ſhould by and by have put off their ſack-cloth and aſhes, and have put on the garments of praiſe and glory; then comes the killing of the Witneſſes This I deſire you to conſider; the killing of the Witneſſes ſhall be ſhortly before
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:115739:95"/> 
                     <hi>Romes</hi> ruine, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. <hi>When they riſe, the tenth part of the City falleth,</hi> which is whole <hi>Rome:</hi> that which now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth being but the tenth part of what it was antient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and therefore doth ſyncronize with <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. <hi>Babylon being caſt in the Sea as a mil-ſtone:</hi> We have great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to expect this to be coming on; and then who are they that ſhall eſcape that great tribulation, ſuch as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver befell the Chriſtian Churches, forrunning their great delivery: <hi>that ſhall ſtand with the Lord, with Palmes in their hands,</hi> as tokens of victory? none but thoſe that having <hi>gone through great tribulation, have waſhed their garments white in the blood of the Lamb:</hi> and that is immediately before the ſeventh Trumpet ſoundeth: and certainly whoſoever ſhall obſerve both the courſe of the Hiſtory, and the courſe of Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of providence, muſt needs conclude, it is not yet come. Now in this conſideration, how good is it for to take this counſel of the Prophet? <hi>It is good for a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to draw neer to God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But you will ſay to me: how ſhould we draw neer?</p>
                  <p>A few directions with a word of Exhortation, and I conclude.</p>
                  <p>There are theſe five Rules that I earneſtly deſire the Lord may write in your hearts, that you may know how the ſoul ought to draw neer to God.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, be much in the uſe of all Ordinances, for in them you do draw neer, <hi>Lev.</hi> 10.3,4. <hi>God will be ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in thoſe that come neer unto him;</hi> you do draw neer in Ordinances: this <hi>is the Bed wherein Chriſt and his Spouſe do ſolace themſelves,</hi> and enjoy the ſweeteſt of pleaſures: and it is of flouriſhing Ordinances that the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-Ghoſt
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:115739:95"/> ſpeaks when he ſaith in <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.16. But yet in all your Ordinances, pray obſerve to take heed that you do mark the ſpecial preſence or abſence of God in them; elſe you may have communion with a duty, when God withdraws himſelf: and know, that Gods withdrawing of himſelf from an Ordinance is a great judgement, <hi>when the glory of the Lord departeth:</hi> for then our Ordinances will be <hi>Wells without water; Breſts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out milk:</hi> there is a vanity in Ordinances as well as in creatures, if God leave them. But as it is a great judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſo it is the fore-runner of Judgement. Oh that the Lord would ſet on that place upon your hearts, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 10.2. the Lord ſaith to the Angel, <hi>Go take fire from off the Altar, and ſcatter over this City;</hi> take fire from off the Altar. If the glory of the Lord depart from the Temple, then the fire of the Altar that before would ſerve to expiate their ſins, will now burn the City, and there is no fire burns ſo hotly as that which is taken from off the Altar. Nay, I deſire you to take this with you, That as you muſt uſe the Ordinances, and obſerve the ſpiritual preſence or abſence of God in them: See</p>
                  <p>That your Ordinances be pure Ordinances, or elſe they will do you no good: See that they be without humane mixture and ſophiſtication: there is a great deal of vanity and pride in men: for truly, <hi>vain man would be wiſe, though he be born like a wild Aſſes colt,</hi> and men love to exerciſe their wiſdom in nothing more then in the things of God, and therefore for matter of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances they will pick and chuſe. <q rend="inline">I deſire you to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and you will find this Rule: The leſs of Gods Order you have, the leſs of Gods preſence, and the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:115739:96"/> leſs of Gods bleſſing.</q> That is the firſt Rule for your drawing neer. Be much in the uſe of all Ordinances. But yet obſerve the ſpiritual preſence, or abſence of God in them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if you will draw neer to God, Walk in a continual fear that God ſhould withdraw himſelf from you. That is another Rule of Communion. Truly, all people that know what belongeth to walking with God, and drawing neer to him, know they muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with ſuch ſpiritual truths: walk in a continual fear of Gods withdrawing of himſelf from you. It was the Churches miſery in <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. <hi>I opened, and my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved had withdrawn himſelf:</hi> my Beloved had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn himſelf. <note place="margin">Auguſt.</note> 
                     <hi>Auguſtine</hi> I remember ſpeaks of a chaſt and of whoriſh fear, a ſinful fear, and he expreſſeth it by the diſpoſition of a Wife, and a Harlot; both ſtand in awe of the Husband, of the man: but (ſaith he) <hi>Haec virum timet ne veniat, illa ne deſcedat:</hi> one fears leaſt the Hushand will come, the other fears leaſt the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band will depart; theſe are the diſpoſitions (certainly) of a ſoul that knows what belongs to Communion with God; a man that hath once obtained Communion with God to approach, but afterwards the Lord departs, it is uncertain whether ever he ſhall obtain that approach of Communion again, or no. <note place="margin">Bernard.</note> I remember it was <hi>Bernards</hi> obſervation (and truly it is a ſad one) ſpeaking of thoſe that did fall from their Communion; ſaith he, <hi>Perpau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos invenimus qui unquam redeunt ad gradum priſtinum:</hi> we ſhall find very few of thoſe that ever obtained their former approach of fellowſhip again: make this your buſineſs, walk in continual fears leaſt the Lord with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw himſelf.</p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:115739:96"/>
                  <p>In the third place; If you would grow in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and draw neer to God, you muſt grow in conformity unto him: for I have told you alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that according as our Conformity is, ſo ſhall our Communion be; ſo I beſeech you obſerve it in <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.10. Chriſt ſaith to his Diſciples, <hi>Keep my Commandments</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and abide in my love, as I have kept my Fathers Commandments, and abide in his love:</hi> abide in his love; doth our abiding in the love of Chriſt ſtand upon our keeping his Commandments? it is ſpoken here of abiding in the ſenſe and the apprehenſion of his love, walking in the light of his countenance: there is a double love of Chriſt unto the Saints: there is <hi>amor benevolentiae &amp; amor complacentiae;</hi> there is a love of benovelence, and that is the ground indeed; it is free grace is the ground of all grace whatſoever: this is not grounded upon our conformity to Chriſt, for <hi>he loved us when we were enemies.</hi> But there is a love of delight, and that is grounded upon the image of God in us, and our conformity unto his: and the Lord ſo much the more delighteth in the creature, as he ſees the more of his image in it. So then, if you would draw neer to God, grow into conformity, and your communion ſhall grow.</p>
                  <p>In the fourth place; Obſerve the times of fellowſhip: I beſeech you remember this: There are peculiar times when God draws neer to you; <hi>molliſsima tempora ſandi:</hi> do you then draw neer to God: <hi>call upon him while he is neer:</hi> that is the expreſſion: the Spirit of God (<hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
                     <pb n="158" facs="tcp:115739:97"/> obſerves, <note place="margin">Tertullian.</note> 
                     <hi>res delicata ſpiritus Chriſti</hi>) is a delicate thing, a delicate Spirit, eaſily provoked to depart when the Lord knocketh, and offers love, and men will not entertain it. Courtiers have their peculiar times of ſpeaking, when they may have Communion in all their requeſts with grace: Obſerve theſe times, the Lord thus draws neer you; cheriſh as your life theſe ſeaſons of times, and theſe ſweet warblings of the Spirit of grace: obſerve when God draws neer to you. That is a fourth Direction.</p>
                  <p>And in the laſt place, Take heed of all thoſe ſins that may interrupt your fellowſhip: it is true indeed, every ſin ſeparateth between us and God: and the ſmalleſt ſin, the ſmalleſt body hath its ſhaddow: but yet notwithſtanding there are ſome ſins that in a more peculiar manner break a mans Communion, and hinder a mans comfort. And here let me give you to underſtand, there is a ſin that the Scripture calls <hi>a mans iniquity, the ſweet morſel that a man hides under his tongue,</hi> and will not forſake: a mans darling, his minion luſt: for as in the new man though there be all grace wrought in a mans heart, yet there be ſome graces that are a mans peculiar excellency, that art more then others. <hi>Abrams</hi> peculiar excellency was his faith: in <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> his chaſtity: in <hi>Iob,</hi> his patience: in <hi>David,</hi> his ſpirituality: Now ſo it is in the old man, though there be all ſins, yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome luſts act more then others: and the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs of a mans heart (as <hi>David</hi> obſerves) lies in this; in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.23. <hi>I was upright before
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:115739:97"/> thee, and I kept my ſelf from mine iniquity.</hi> Now there is no ſin that ingroſſeth the heart like to this; therefore there is no ſin keeps the heart ſo much from Communion with God as this; therefore above all evils, as you do deſire to draw neer to God, ſo take heed above all ſins, keep down the darling corruption: for there is no ſin (I ſay) that ingroſſeth the heart ſo much: there is no ſin that caſteth ſo much ſhame in the face, and takes off the Spirit in all his approaches to God, as this: Then theſe be the Rules that I commend to your conſideration, if you would keep cloſe Communion with God. Be much in the uſe of all Ordinances, walk in a continual fear leaſt God ſhould withdraw himſelf from them. Grow in your conformity, and you ſhall grow in your Communion. Obſerve eſpecially thoſe times when God draweth neer to you. And in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner take care to keep your ſelves from your own iniquity.</p>
                  <p>To enforce this exhortation, take theſe few conſiderations:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, you may draw neer to God by reaſon of the neer Relations in which you ſtand to him: the great promiſes of the Goſpel be perſonal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, <hi>I will be thy God, and give thee my Son and my Spirit.</hi> Now when God makes over himſelf by Covenant unto the creature, its a great ground of our coming to him: had he ſaid I will be to thee a Father or a Husband, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it would have but carried with it all the comforts that could have been in ſuch a relation: but when he ſaith, <hi>I will be thy
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:115739:98"/> God,</hi> that is, <hi>tant us quantus eſt:</hi> what ever there is in God ſhall be as truly thine for thy good, as it is his for his own glory: my mercy to pardon thee, my power to perfect thee, my wiſdom to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect thee: my grace to heal thee, my glory to crown thee, and therefore <hi>David</hi> called him <hi>the God of my mercy,</hi> and <hi>the God of my life:</hi> and your intereſt in him may be a great encouragement to you to draw neer to him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the more a man draws neer to God, the more communion he hath with him, the more he ſhall be acquainted with the ſecrets of God: for communion lies much in imparting of ſecrets. <hi>Abraham</hi> is called <hi>the friend of God:</hi> and he had gotten ſuch an intereſt in him, that God can do nothing that he will hide from <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 18. <hi>And Moſes, God will ſpeak to him as a man with his friend ſace to face.</hi> 1 Sam. 9.15. <hi>The Lord told</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel <hi>in his ear.</hi> In this reſpect it may be truly ſaid, <hi>the ſecret of the Lord is with them that fear him:</hi> and <hi>his Urim and Thumim,</hi> with <hi>his holy ones; theſe lean upon the Lords boſom</hi> from day to day, and that is the ſeat of ſecrets as well as of love.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the more a man draws neer to God, the more acceptable will all his ſervices be; and therefore the more <hi>Moſes</hi> appeared before God, and <hi>ſtood in the gap,</hi> the more God delighted in him, and <hi>he turned away the wrath of God from his people.</hi> Job <hi>muſt pray for his friends,</hi> and the Lord will hear him; though they were godly men, yet they were not contented that it ſhould be only well with them,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:115739:98"/> but they wreſtled with God for others, and God will honour them with the anſwer of prayers, for they that draw moſt neer to God, and God draws neer to them, are the men of his good will; God will ſay unto them, <hi>Concerning my ſons, and the works of my hands, command ye me,</hi> &amp;c. and therefore <hi>Bernard</hi> ſpeaking of ſuch times of Communion, <note place="margin">Bernard.</note> 
                     <hi>Dulce com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercium, ſed Breve momentum,</hi> ſaith he; when it is ſo with a man, then pray for me; <hi>cum talis fueris me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento mei;</hi> for then his prayers will ſurely prevail. <hi>Moſes</hi> prays, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. <hi>Lord pardon them,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>God repented of the evil he thought to have done to his people,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>My preſence ſhall go before thee, and I will give thee reſt; Lord ſhew me thy glory; Thou canſt not ſee my face and live, but I will cauſe my goodneſs to paſs before thee:</hi> God can in ſuch approaches unto the ſoul deny them nothing.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the more a man ſhall proſper in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he doth undertake; <hi>Joſeph</hi> was a ſucceſsful man in all his undertakings; and the ground of it was, becauſe <hi>the Lord was with him, Gen.</hi> 39. laſt: he kept conſtant Communion with God: and ſo <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> in all things that he did he proſpered, <hi>for the Lord was with him,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11.9. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 5. the ground of all <hi>Joſhua's</hi> ſucceſs in war was, <hi>becauſe the Lord was with him;</hi> I know a godly man doth prize his ſervices above his comforts, his work above his wages: as one of the Martyrs ſaid when he came to dye, Nothing did grieve him more, then that he was now going to a place where he ſhould be for ever receiving wages, and never do any more work. Now if you would be employed by God, and would
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:115739:99"/> have the Lord to delight to uſe you, and proſper you in your undertakings, keep cloſe to him.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, the more fellowſhip you have with God, the more friendſhip you ſhall find among men: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the people of God are commonly the perſons that are moſt evil ſpoken of in the world; <hi>the evil eyes of vain men are ſet againſt them</hi> and they will do what they can, to render them unſavoury; and they learn from their father the Devil, to caſt aſperſions on them: But yet notwithſtanding, they are the Lords darlings, and are precious in his ſight: the world may throw dirt on them, but it ſhall not ſtick or faſten there: and if it be good for them, they ſhall be <hi>delivered from the ſtrife of evil tongues:</hi> and in evil times, when dangers come, when the enemy encamps the City, God will give them fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in the ſight of their enemies. God gave <hi>Ioſeph</hi> favour in the ſight of the Keeper of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.21. and <hi>Ier.</hi> 3.9,11. <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> gave charge concerning <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> a poor man in a danger, when the reſt of the great Princes were not conſidered: and among the godly, they have the higheſt place in their hearts: <hi>All my delight is in the Saints,</hi> ſaith <hi>David.

                  <p>Sixthly: Laſtly, it is the higheſt pitch of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for any people to have God for their God: the People of God make this their great Boaſt, <hi>Who is a God like unto our God?</hi> and the neerer they come to

               </p>
               <p>Firſt, the Saints have an Inheritance; Chriſt is by the Father <hi>appointed heir of all things,</hi> Heb. 1.13. As he is the Son, he is <hi>haeres natus;</hi> as he is the Mediator, he is <hi>haeres conſtitutus:</hi> The one by <hi>Generation,</hi> which was an act of his Nature; and the other <hi>Deſignation,</hi> which was an act of his Will. Now the Saints being made Sons by the Sonſhip of Chriſt, they are alſo made <hi>co-heirs with him</hi> in his Inheritance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17.</p>
               <p>And his Inheritance being all things, ſo muſt theirs be.</p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:115739:101"/>
               <p>There are two things in Chriſt to be diſtinguiſhed.</p>

               <p>Secondly, there is <hi>Meritum,</hi> which is a purchaſe made as it was perform'd by a perſon that was not bound unto the Law. The Law indeed required it of Men, but not of him that was God and Man; and ſo the excellency of the perſon is the ground of the Merit, and of the Purchaſe, and the Inheritance; for though it be true, <hi>Meritum Chriſti habet in ſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam inviſceratam,</hi> there is the free grace of God in all the merit of Chriſt: Yet there is nothing that is ſo pure grace, but that there is a purchaſe alſo therein: That the Father may be truly ſaid to give it, and Chriſt truly ſaid to purchaſe it alſo. And this Inheritance is as full and large as could be deſired; for it is <hi>all things,</hi> Rev. 21.7. <hi>He that ouercomes ſhall inherit all things: All things are yours;</hi>

               <p>Firſt, all things are for their uſe. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10. <hi>As having nothing, and yet poſſeſsing all things.</hi> So that though the Saints do not ingroſs all things unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by way of a Monopoly, yet as far as their neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:115739:101"/> ſhall require they may expect the uſe and the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of them all; ſo that whatſoever extraordinary experiment any of the antient Saints have had of the ſervice of the creatures when they have needed them, that they alſo may expect, as their exigencies and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities ſhall require: <hi>The Heavens to rain bread, and Rocks to give water, and the Sun to ſtand ſtill, and the Moon to go badk;</hi> for the Saints are the Lords of all the creatures, and all things ſhall be for their uſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have an intereſt in him that is the Lord of Hoſts.<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, all things are the Saints for their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and they can taſt a goodneſs, and a ſweetneſs in them all; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17. He <hi>gives us all things richly to enjoy,</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: And indeed in this reſpect, we muſt onely, <hi>mundo uti &amp; frui Deo;</hi> for he is onely to be the reſt and delight of the ſoul: <note place="margin">So the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men tell us, <hi>fruitio eſt fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis.</hi>
                  </note> In the utmoſt end attain'd, we have the greateſt comfort that a ſoul can be capable of; it is <hi>nobliſſima voluntatis actio,</hi> and ſo as <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.25. <hi>Injoy the pleaſures of ſin:</hi> Other plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures enjoyed, become pleaſures of ſin; all creatures enjoy'd, become the baits and the ſnares to ſin; but here, fruition, as one hath well obſerved, ſignifies nothing elſe but <hi>cum laetitia rem aliquam perci pere,</hi> and ſo God hath given a godly man the creatures, and all things, that he may take comfort in them: And this is the Saints portion, that they may have all theſe things as a <hi>Viaticum</hi> in their way to heaven: Though their happineſs lyes not in theſe things; theſe things are not the peculiar gifts of God to them; even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate men may have the creatures; <hi>For God gives the Kingdoms of the earth to the baſeſt of men,</hi> but they have no comfort in them; they have only the ſting, the <hi>gall and the wormwood</hi> that is in them,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:115739:102"/> all his dayes <hi>he eats his meat in darkneſs,</hi> Eccleſ. And he hath ſorrow with his dainties.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, a godly man hath a ſpiritual fruit and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by them; all of them tend to his bleſſing, and to the proſperity of his inward man: They are <hi>ſcala caeli,</hi> and the ſoul climbs to heaven by them, as it's ſaid of King <hi>Jehoſhahat,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Chron. 17.5,6.</note> 
                  <hi>he had riches and honour in abundance, and his heart was encouraged in the wayes of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. whereas to other men their Table be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a ſnare to their ſoul; it's to them as lime to their wings, that they cannot aſcend up to heaven: They are <hi>pondus,</hi> the weight that keeps the ſoul groveling here below: There's a double evil befallen the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſince that curſe came upon them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.17. it's deceiving, and it's defiling.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They deceive; they are themſelves empty, yet raiſe mens expectations from them: He that depends on them, <hi>ſeeds on aſhes,</hi> Iſa. 44.20. and comes under the Serpents curſe, <hi>Duſt ſhalt thou eat:</hi> and when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends moſt thereon, is as he that worſhippeth an Idol, <hi>who hath a lye in his right hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. They defile; <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. <hi>to the unclean all things are unclean.</hi> Now in the covenant that the Lord made with the creatures, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.19,20, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> God promiſes not onely that they ſhall not be hurting, but that they ſhall not be poluting to the ſoules of the people of God Grace ſhall make advantage by them all, and they ſhal all of them work together unto a mans ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual good, that the ſoul ſhal ſhine, &amp; proſper by them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly they ſhall all of them have an influence into eternity, and all of them ſhall adde to a mans eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal account, and a man ſhall have the fruit of them in his eternal inheritance; <hi>A man makes friends of the unrighteous Mammon, and therein makes himſelf bags that
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:115739:102"/> wax not old,</hi> Luk. 12.23. and thereby lays up a good foundation for time to come, that he may lay hold of eternal life; for we are but Stewards of what we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, and we muſt one day give an account anſwerable to the improvement of thoſe Talents committed to us by God, ſuch will our honour be at the laſt, <hi>thou haſt been faithful in the Mammon of unrighteouſneſs, and therefore the Lord will not fail to give unto thee the true Treaſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the <hi>Tenure</hi> is, <hi>ye are Chriſts;</hi> for we hold all <hi>in Capite,</hi> all by virtue of <hi>Union; Omnes communio fundatur in unione;</hi> our communion with him is in his graces, in his priviledges, in his victories, in his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, in his inheritance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But whats the ground of it? It's from our union. It's the higheſt glory of a man, next the glory of God, that ſuch a glorious creature as a woman ſhould be made for his comfort and ſervice; <hi>for the man was not created for the woman, but the woman for the man:</hi> So the higheſt glory of God is Chriſt, as God-Man, that he ſhould become ſubject to him: That he that was the Lord of the Law, ſhould be <hi>made under the Law;</hi> he that was <hi>God equal with the Fother,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.3,4.</note> and <hi>thought it no robbery</hi> ſo to be. So Chriſt holds his right to all things from God, and we hold ours from Chriſt by vertue of union with him.</p>
               <p>There is a double dominion; There is <hi>dominium politicum,</hi> and that is grounded upon the providential Kingdom, that Chriſt as the Lord hath beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him by God all the ſervices of the creatures; for he hath bought all the creatures, even all the world of God; not onely the Saints, but ungodly men alſo; for, there are <hi>ſome deny the Lord that bought them.</hi> But he buyes them not all alike; but ſome as ſervants, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:115739:103"/> as ſonnes, ſome their perſons, and others their ſervices onely; and as ſervants he doth give unto them a reward; and they have a right to it, but its onely a right of Providence, as they are ſervants: But now there is another right, which is <hi>dominium E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelicum,</hi> a right as ſons, as they be pledges of a mans eternal inheritance, and flow from a Fathers love, a right of the promiſe: and ſo its onely union with Chriſt that gives ſuch a right; <hi>fundatur in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> and can belong to none but unto the Saints; for, its the Covenant that is the ground of all our claim unto any of the creatures in a ſpiritual ſence; for that is the root and the center of all the promiſes; and its our union with Chriſt that brings us under the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and therefore makes us <hi>heirs of all the promiſes;</hi> and by this means the Inheritance of the Saints is theirs, becauſe, <hi>they are Christs, and Chriſt is Gods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have here alſo an Inventory of the Saints, a particular enumeration of this <hi>all things,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>That which I am engaged in at preſent, is this <hi>(things to come.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Man being a creature both prudent, and provident, cannot be ſatisfied that it's well with him for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but his mind is taken up about what ſhall be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, and concerning either the good, or evil things to come; doth raiſe up to himſelf vaſt hopes or fears; for in both theſe the ſoul goes out to things to come: The ſoul is apt to ſay, I know how it's with me for the preſent, but my mind is taken up with what ſhall be hereafter; my Mountain may prove but <hi>a mountain of ſnow,</hi> it may melt; what changes there may be I know not: All things here are compared to <hi>Wheels,</hi> Ezek. 1. that which was upmoſt one minute, is down the next; Wheels are <hi>in perpetuo motu,</hi> in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:115739:103"/> motion; ſometimes compar'd to the ſea, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.3. which is <hi>in perpetuo fluxu,</hi> in a continual flowing, and therefore how it may be with me hereafrer, I know not: Now to ſecure the ſoul againſt any diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions for the future, the Lord aſſures the ſoul of things to come: <note place="margin">Job.</note> 
                  <hi>The thing that I feared is come upon me: I had not reſt, neither was I quiet, and yet trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble came.</hi> The heads of men are apt to frame ſtrange ſuppoſitions to it ſelf; and indeed it is a mans duty ſo to do in reference to a preparation, that ſo <hi>evil do not come upon him unawares;</hi> for, <hi>mala praeviſa minùs ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timus:</hi> Though as it's matter of dejection, it's a mans ſin: <note place="margin">Hab. 3.18.</note> 
                  <hi>Though the Fig-tree ſhould not bloſsom, neither ſhall fruit be in the Vines; the labour of the olives ſhall fail,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Yet I will rejoice in the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <note place="margin">Pſalm 46.1.</note> 
                  <hi>Though the earth be moved, and the mountains be caſt into the depths of the ſea.</hi> What if the Sun be darkned, and if the Stars fall from Heaven? What if the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be caſt down? We know how things are for the preſent, and what our Inheritance in them is, but what if the face of things change? What may be my Inheritance for time to come, and in things to come, I know not: Therefore the Lord aſſures the Saints, that they have not onely a preſent Inheritance, but alſo in things to come, that they are theirs alſo: <hi>Things to come are yours.</hi>

                  <p>Firſt, God hath made over unto them things to come. The ſubſtance of all the promiſes, is <hi>things to come,</hi> whether they do refer unto the life that now is, or that which ſhall be hereafter; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. Now, the Saints <hi>Inherit the promiſes,</hi> Heb. 6.12. The Word of God is
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:115739:104"/> in ſcripture ſomtimes compared unto a Travelling wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and there is a time of the birth of the threatning, and of the promiſe: <note place="margin">Zeph. 2.1,2,3. It is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                     </note> It's a metaphor taken from beaſts for which men lay ſnares, and then hunt them, that they may be driven into thoſe ſnares, and ſo take them. There is a purſuit of the threatning of God upon ungodly men; and there is alſo a purſuit of the promiſes of God upon the Saints.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, upon this ground it is that the Saints are the onely men that have hope, and therefore they are called the <hi>priſoners of hope</hi> in the greateſt calamity that is upon them, <hi>Zach.</hi> 9.12. Thoſe that have not onely a hope in this life, but in that alſo which is to come. Ungodly men do fancy unto themſelves hope, but its but kindling a fire of their own, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.11. <hi>and they compaſſe themſelves about with their own ſparks, when they lye down in ſorrow:</hi> It's not a living hope, it dyes with the man; but the Saints are <hi>begotten to a lively hope,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.3. Now hope is <hi>converſant about things to come,</hi> as fear is; but the one about good things to come, as the other is about evil things; there is this difference between.

                  <p>But hope looks upon it in the thing; and that looks upon it as to come: now if things to come were not theirs, there were no ground of the hope of the Saints, they were altogether vain hopes.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. They are delivered from temptations to come: A man ſhall be delivered from them, and not left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; and there is a great deal of mercy in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting grace of God this way, in being freed from temptations: The Lord will not lead his People through the Land of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. If Temptations ſometimes aſſault them, yet he doth make proviſion for them againſt Temptation: <hi>Satan hath deſired to winnow thee,</hi> ſaith our Lord to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi>

                     <hi>but I have prayed for thee:</hi> The Lord lays in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation for the future tryals of the Saints; and as the Temptation was fore-appointed, ſo alſo is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.11.

                  <p n="3">3. Afflictions to come, either they ſhall be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from them, as <hi>Hezekiah; thou ſhalt,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>be gathered into thy grave in peace:</hi> God had an Ark for <hi>Noah,</hi> and a Grave for <hi>Methuſalah:</hi> The Floud was appointed to come upon all the Earth, well, at the time appointed it comes: But firſt, <hi>Methuſalah</hi> muſt be

                  <p n="4">4. Mercies to come to the Saints ſhall prove Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies indeed: <hi>Saul</hi> hath a Kingdom as wel as <hi>David,</hi> but it was a mercy to <hi>David,</hi> and therefore the Lord did qualifie him for it, and gave him Kingly graces, and weaned hii ſoul from the Mercy before he had; <note place="margin">Bernard.</note> 
                     <hi>Bern. Ecce paratum eſt cor meum; vis me conſtituere paſtorem ovium, aut regem populorum: My heart is as a weaned child,</hi> Pſal. 131.2,3. And therefore it's ſayd, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.18. <hi>that the Lord waits to be gracious;</hi> he doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer becauſe he is unwilling to beſtow mercies upon us, but becauſe we are not prepared to receive Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; for Mercies to unprepared ſoules, are like unto Cordials unto foul ſtomacks, the which do but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the peccant humours; and therefore the Lord never gives them till the ſeaſon of them, and till he hath prepared the ſoul to receive them. There is a double right that the people of God have to Mercy. Firſt, there is <hi>jus haereditarium,</hi> a right of Inheritance, and that they have as ſoon as they are converted; but
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:115739:106"/> yet they are but then as a child in its nonage. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there is a <hi>jus aptitudinarium,</hi> a right of fitneſs that is wanting; and the Lord doth not give any Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, in Mercy, till both be found in the ſoul; till there is a right of fitneſs as well as an hereditary right.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Sins to come. If God leaves under any temptation, that we are foyled by it (as that the beſt of Gods people may; for I know no ſin but may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertake ſuch but final impenitency, and the ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Holy Ghoſt) yet all things ſhall work toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for good to them that fear God. <hi>Et ſi omnia, qui ni etiam peccata;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Aug.</note> Aug. If all things, then ſin it ſelf is not excluded. God makes a ſtrange uſe of ſin, to his peoples good and benefit; either to diſcover unto a man what is in his heart, and ſo to abate his carnal confidence, as the Lord did let <hi>Hezekiah</hi> fall to that end, that the work of Mortification may be perfected, and the Sword of Godly ſorrow may go the wider, and the Plough of Repentance the deeper; and that ſhall be the fruit of it, that the man may be more vile in his own ſight; or elſe to make him the more inſtrumental in that kind to do good unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, being able to comfort them with the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation with which he himſelf was comforted of <hi>God:</hi> And being <hi>himſelf converted,</hi> he may be the better able to convert, and <hi>ſtrengthen the brethren,</hi> Luk. 22.32. And the Saints of God do ſee great Mercy even in their ſins to come, as well as in their ſuffering; that as ſome of the Antients have bleſſed God for the Falls of the Saints, thoſe <hi>Horrenda naufragia;</hi> by reaſon of the comfort, and ſupport, and admonitions that they had from them: So they do ſee cauſe many times to bleſs God for that Grace that brings ſo much
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:115739:106"/> good out of their ſins alſo; and ſo much they may promiſe themſelves from a principle of Faith, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of ſinning as well as ſuffering.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, in reſpect of the happy and glorious condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church that is promiſed in the latter daies; there is a time coming, when <hi>all the kingdoms of the earth ſhall become the kingdoms of the Lord, and of his Chriſt.</hi> Rev. 11.16,17. and <hi>unto the holy people of the moſt high,</hi> Dan 17.27. <hi>And when the ſmoak out of the Temple ſhall vantſh, and the Temple ſhall be opened in heaven, and a man may ſee into the Court of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament which is within the vayl.</hi> The darkneſs of the pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Seventhly, in reference to the deſtruction of the Enemies of the Church: <note place="margin">Rev. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>The Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath a Winepreſſe to tread, and a Vintage to gather. It's the Winepreſs of the fierce wrath of God, who is almighty, when the blood ſhall be up to the briales of the horſes,</hi> &amp;c. which is in the times of the third Angel, and it hath a more ſpecial and peculiar aſpect upon the times in which
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:115739:107"/> we live; then the Saints ſhall rejoyce when they ſee the vengeance and wrath of God upon the ungodly; <hi>and they ſhall ſing Hallelujah, praiſe, and glory, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour be unto thee (O Lord) for thou haſt judged the great whore, and avenged the blood of thy Saints,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.2.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, the glory of Heaven is to come, but the Saints do rejoyce here in the hope of it, <hi>and do bathe themſelves in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſe Rivers of pleaſures which ſhall be for evermore,</hi> &amp;c. By this hope, <hi>Anima aſcendit frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tèr, &amp; currit plateas caelest is Jeruſalem.</hi> By this doe they ſee God in a fiducial, though not in the beatifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal viſion. And a man <hi>having this hope he doth purifie himſelf that he way be made a meet partaker of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed hope that is ſet before him.</hi> So that all things to come do make for the good of the Saints; ſurely <hi>things to come are theirs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what are the grounds of the intereſt that the people of God have in <hi>things to come?</hi> Conſider theſe five.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Lord hath ordered his eternal decrees con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>things to come;</hi> ſo that they ſhall not only make for his own glory, but alſo for the good of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; <note place="margin">Eph. 1.11.</note> for <hi>he doth work all things according to the counſel of his own will.</hi> He did not onely from all eternity chuſe his peoples eternal eſtates, and chuſe them to glory, but he hath a decree that paſſeth upon all things to come, in the government of this world, as may conduce unto this end, and as may further this great decree and grand deſign of God: For though in the decrees of God, ſome Divines doe obſerve, that there are not <hi>priora &amp; poſteriora,</hi> becauſe they are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, and <hi>in aeternitate non eſt prius &amp; poſterius,</hi> yet there are <hi>ſubordinata,</hi> one thing may be ſubordinated
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:115739:107"/> to another, as the means are to the end; <hi>for he hath choſen us to glory and virtue,</hi> the one as the end, the other as the means, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. And ſo the grand deſign of God, is the glory, and eternal good of all the Saints; and he hath ſubordinated all things in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the whole creation of God unto this great and principal end, <hi>all things to come ſhall work together for their good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is for their ſakes, that he hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the world unto the government of Chriſt; <note place="margin">Iſa. 9.8.</note> for it is by their Covenant that the world ſtands; and 'tis for their ſakes that he hath undertaken the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the world, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. laſt. <hi>He hath made him the head over all things to the Church.</hi> Chriſt is not a head over all things, as he is the head of the Church. He is a head of guidance unto all things; but he is a head of influence unto the Church alſo; and he did undertake the government of all things for the Elect ſake, <hi>That he might gather them all together under one head, even in him,</hi> Eph. 1.10. And he that doth rule all things for their ſakes, they need not fear but he will over-rule all things for their good; and therefore all things which are in the government of Chriſt doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long wholly unto the good of the Saints.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, hence Chriſt doth exerciſe a peculiar providence over his own people; which is a great mercy. There is a common providence which doth extend unto the meaneſt creatures; <hi>not a ſparrow doth fall to the ground, not a hair from off your head,</hi> without it. But there is a ſpecial providence over all the Saints, <hi>he is the Saviour of all men, but eſpecially of them that beleeve.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.10.</note> It's ſpoken of a temporal ſalvation, and there is a ſpecial providence over the Saints in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to temporal things: Yet how apt are the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:115739:108"/> pie of God many times to diſtruſt the providence of God even in theſe: <hi>O ye of little Faith, are you not much better then many ſparrows,</hi> &amp;c. Conſider but the projects of this providence for the Saints good in reference unto things to come; 'tis exceeding re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable how they have been overſhaddowed by a ſpecial providence, whilſt they live in this world: When the Saints ſhall come to Heaven, and ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand all the dealings of God towards them whilſt they lived here below, and the grounds thereof, that they may give God the glory of it. <note place="margin">Suarez.</note> 
                     <hi>Beatus in Deo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>det res omnes accommodas ad ſe pertinentes, &amp; omnes circumſtantias accommodatas,</hi> Suarez. Then when all things ſhall be opened and layd together, then it will appear how gloriouſly God watched over them for their good by all, <hi>things to come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, hence it is, that in the <hi>oeconomical</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt the Angels have their government, and they doe order things to come ſtrangely for the Saints good; for though no creature can know things to come of themſelves, yet by Revelation they do; for they receive from Chriſt, <note place="margin">Rev. 19.10.</note> 
                     <hi>a ſpirit of Prophecie,</hi> and they are employed as Officers under him in the government of all things, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. <hi>The ſpirit of the living creatures is in the wheels,</hi> and that was the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, <hi>chap.</hi> 10.20. and <hi>ver.</hi> 19. <hi>When the living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures went, the wheels went by them, and when they were lifted up, the wheels were lifted up; for the ſpirit of the living creatures is in the wheels:</hi> and this is, becauſe <hi>they are ſent forth as Miniſtring ſpirits for the good of the Elect,</hi> Heb. 1.14. And when Chriſt gives up his kingdom to the Father, he will put down theirs; <hi>for he will put down all rule, and all authority, and power,</hi> for they were made <hi>principalities</hi> and <hi>powers,</hi> onely
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:115739:108"/> under the kingdom of Chriſt; and ſo long their principality ſhall laſt, and no longer, as we ſee <hi>Dan.</hi> 10.20. <hi>I goe forth and fight againſt the King of Perſia, and then the Prince of Grecia ſhall come,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, God hath ſubjected things to come unto the prayers of his people, and thereby joyn'd them, as it were in the ſame commiſſion with his Son, the Lord Chriſt, in the government of the world: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.11. <hi>Ask me concerning things to come, concerning my ſons, and concerning the workes of my hands command you me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>There are two things that the providence of God is extended to; and they are either matters of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon providence, and they are concerning the works of his hands: And alſo matters Eccleſiaſtical, which concern his Church, and <hi>all things to come;</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both, he hath ſubjected unto the prayers of his people, and therefore <hi>ye that are the Lords remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancers, keep not ſilence:</hi> And therefore <hi>Revel.</hi> 4.5. it's ſaid, <hi>out of the Throne proceeded thunder, and lightning, and voices:</hi> Out of the prayers of his people are the great Mercies and Judgements; the great turnes of the world are brought about and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed by this, the Saints working together with God; and therefore at the laſt day, when the cauſes of all things ſhall be layd open, it will appear, all theſe great things that are diſpenſt either in a way of Mercy, or in a way of Judgement, were attain'd by Prayer.</p>

The Lord ſpeaks in the Perſon of his People, reproving them, and inſtructing them: reproving them, that though the Lord ſaith, we heard a voice of trembling, <hi>ſocordiam exprobrat:</hi> It was in it ſelf a voice of trembling, but the people trembled not: I and the people that foreſaw the calamity; yet they were ſo unwiſe as not to tremble: <hi>A wiſe man foreſees the evil, and he trembles;</hi> all that were wiſe hearted did tremble, but the generality of the people did not tremble; and to inſtruct them the Lord directs them what they ſhould ſay, and how they ſhould be affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the calamities that were coming upon them: <hi>We have heard a voice of trembling,</hi> and the Lord would at the laſt extort that acknowledgment and confeſſion from them, how ſecure and ſenceleſs ſo ever they were under his preſent hand: and when they were brought into the ſence of it, they ſhould cry out, <hi>Alaſs! for the day is great,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Here is firſt <hi>Jacobs</hi> Affliction: <hi>It's the time of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs trouble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, His Conſolation; <hi>But he ſhall be ſaved out of it:</hi> Here firſt we are to conſider what is meant by <hi>Jacob: Jacob</hi> is commonly put for all the Tribes, they being all called by their Fathers Name, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Jacob,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Iſrael.</hi> We ſee it put ſo, Mich. 1.5. <hi>For the Tranſgreſſion of</hi> Jacob <hi>is all this, and for the ſin of</hi> Iſrael: <note place="margin">Deut. 32.9.</note> What <hi>is the Tranſgreſſion of</hi> Jacob? <hi>Is it not Samaria,</hi> &amp;c? <hi>The Lords portion is his People;</hi> Jacob <hi>is the Lot of his Inheritance;</hi> But <hi>Iſrael</hi>

               <p>2. What's meant by the time of trouble? It's in the Original, <note place="margin">Hab. 3.16.</note> 
                  <hi>tempus auguſtiae,</hi> a time of ſtraits; which is called <hi>a day of ſtraits, when the Lord did come up upon them and invade them with his Troops:</hi> for ſo the Army of the <hi>Babylonians</hi> is called: when they ſhould be led into Captivity by the will and command of others, for their Perſons and Eſtates to be made

Now to be under the power of men, and not to be ſubjected to their luſts, and ſerve the luſts of men, it's a great ſtrait; and ſtraits alſo in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the affliction, having their lives alway hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in doubt; having <hi>their bread by weight, and their water by meaſure;</hi> and in reſpect of ſuccour, in a great ſtrait alſo, <hi>for there was no deliverer:</hi> Lam. 1.3.

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly; it's called a great day, <hi>magnum pro formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dabile,</hi> Cal. <hi>Terribilis aut mire calamitoſa, à magnitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine ſupplicii, magnus nominatur.</hi> Theodor. And we doe read of five Great Dayes in the Scripture.</p>

                     </gap>f the Lord:</hi> that is interpreted, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.17. of <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> who was to be the forerunner of
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:115739:112"/> Chriſts coming: And this is called a great day, for the great manifeſtations of God, <hi>wherein life and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality ſhould be brought to light by the Goſpel;</hi> the great changes of Ordinances, and the great deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Enemies, the terrible Judgements that ſhould then be poured out; for <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.1. <hi>The day cometh that ſhall burn as an Oven, and all that do wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhall be ſtubble;</hi> that is, <hi>when the Sun of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs doth ariſe with healing in his wings,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>Secondly, there's <hi>the great day of Jezreel,</hi> Hoſ. 1. laſt.

               <pb n="691" facs="tcp:115739:112"/>
               <p>Thirdly, there's a <hi>great day, when the battel Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mageddon ſhall be fought,</hi> Rev. 16.14. When all the Powers of the earth ſhall rally and gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether their broken Troops againſt the Church of God; they ſhall be the greateſt combination that ever hath been, and in which all the oppoſite Powers ſhall be utterly and finally broken; and thereby way ſhall be made for the <hi>vial poured upon the air,</hi> which brings in <hi>the binding of Satan,</hi> chap. 20.

Now from the great preparations that the enemies do make, and the great deſtruction which then they ſhall be ſure to find, and the great things which ſhall follow upon this, and that in this day the Lord will make way for, therefore it's called, <hi>the great day of God Almighty;</hi> when the Lord ſhall fulfil all his promiſes, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, and <hi>Chriſt ſhall be cloathed with a garment dipt in blood, and his name ſhall be called the Word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>the day of Judgement</hi> is a great day al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, <hi>the Angels are ſaid to be reſerved in chains of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto the Judgement of the great day; for then ſhall the ſon of man ſit upon the throne of his glory, and all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhall be gathered together before him;</hi> and he ſhall ſeparate them one from another, as a Shepheard di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides his Sheep from the Goats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and he ſhall then paſſe a finall ſentence, an eternall judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the eternal eſtates of men, and ſet a gulph between them for ever, which they ſhall never paſs; &amp; when he hath ſo done, he ſhall reſign, <hi>or give up his kingdom unto God the Father,</hi> and then all the preſent wayes of adminiſtration ſhall ceaſe.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, when the Lord brings any ſpeciall judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or affliction upon his people, that alſo is called <hi>a great day,</hi> Zeph. 1.14. <hi>the great day of the Lord is near,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:115739:113"/> it's a day of darkneſs and gloomineſs, a day of clouds and thick darkneſs,</hi> that <hi>Trumpet and Alarum againſt the fenced Cities, and againſt the high Towers;</hi> it's a threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſame Judgement there which here the Prophet ſpeaks of, <hi>the captivity of Babylon;</hi> and its called the <hi>great day of the Lord,</hi> and ſo it's here called alſo.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it's ſaid that it's ſuch a day that there is none like to it; that is,</p>
               <p>Firſt, it is the greateſt evil that ever befell that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they had been ſmitten with Peſtilence, with ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of bread, cleaneſs of teeth, invaſions of Enemies, but never any like unto this, and therefore does the Prophet call it, <hi>an onely evil,</hi> Ezek. 7.5,6,7. <hi>it's come;</hi> and it is not a high ſound, the eccho of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, but it ſhall be ſo in truth, and in reality, in which the <hi>fury of the Lord ſhall be poured out upon them;</hi> he would give the dearly beloved of his ſoul into the hand of his enemies.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there's none like it, if we alſo compare Gods dealing with them, and with other people: <hi>The Lord hath not dealt ſo with any Nation, as he hath done with Jeruſalem,</hi> and therefore they are afflicted, and in captivity with the heathen Nations, who are at eaſe and ſit ſtil, <hi>Zach.</hi> 1.13.14. <hi>For judgement muſt begin at the Houſe of God;</hi> and there is at the laſt a worſe end remaining, <hi>for them that obey not the Goſpel, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, here's a conſolation alſo, <hi>Jacob</hi> ſhall have his time of trouble, but it is yet but a time; the people of God never enter into affliction without a promiſe, and therefore they are <hi>priſoners of hope, when they are in a pit in which there's no water, Zach.</hi> 9.11,12. There are three great promiſes that the Saints have under all their afflictions.</p>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:115739:113"/>
               <p>Firſt, they are promiſed ſupport in the affliction, <hi>I will be with you;</hi> and, <hi>there's a River, the ſtreames whereof do make glad the City of God;</hi> Gen. 15. there's <hi>a light that goes between the peeces, in the middle of the darkneſs: the buſh in the fire is not burnt:</hi> a peculiar providence watches over them, to keep them from fainting under the affliction.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they are promiſed Sanctification: <hi>This is the fruit of the affliction, to take away their ſins: by this ſhall the iniquity of Jacob be purged; they ſhall be made partakers of his holyneſſe;</hi> and of his glory; <hi>for theſe light afflictions that are but for a moment, ſhall work for us a more exceeding, and eternal weight of glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, there's a promiſe of deliverance out of affliction: <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall not dye in <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gypt,</hi> though it be four hundred years before they come forth; <hi>though the Temple be trodden down of the Gentiles, and the woman be in the wilderneſs</hi> 1260. <hi>dayes,</hi> yet ſhe ſhall not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies be in a wilderneſs eſtate; and though they be in <hi>Babylon,</hi> yet the Lord by the blood of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant will <hi>ſend them forth out of the pit,</hi> and <hi>he will break the yoke from off the neck of the anointing,</hi> &amp;c. And ſome think (as <hi>Calvin</hi>) that to be the meaning of <hi>Iſ.</hi> 9.1. <hi>Her dimneſs ſhall not be ſuch as was in her vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when he firſt lightly afflicted the land of Zabulon,</hi> &amp;c. that was, in the inroads formerly made upon them by <hi>Tiglah Pileſer,</hi> and was that greater then the captivity when the City ſhould be deſtroyed, and the Temple burnt with fire, and there was no compariſon in the affliction, but yet the darkneſs ſhould not be ſuch; and the reaſon is this, <hi>huic certa permiſſionem eſſe additam, cum in prioribus nulla eſſet,</hi> better be as low as Hel with a promiſe, then in Paradiſe without it; <hi>the darkneſs of
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:115739:114"/> the bottomleſs pit would not be utter darkneſs,</hi> if there were but the light of a promiſe, for the ſoul to look upon, for <hi>there is a time of the pro niſe</hi> Acts 7.17. <hi>when it will truly ſpeak, and not lye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what are the grounds why God will not ſpare his own people?</p>
               <p>Hence the grounds are theſe two.</p>
               <p>Firſt, God will not ſpare his own people; there's <hi>a time of Jacoh's trouble,</hi> when even Gods own people ſhall be reduced to extremity, and there ſhall come upon them a time of ſtraits.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Jacobs trouble is but for a time; there's a day of deliverance for them,</hi> they ſhall be ſaved out of it.</p>
               <p>The Doctrine is this.</p>
               <div n="1" type="doctrine">
                  <head>Doctrin.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>There is a time of Jacobs trouble: Gods own deareſt: people are many times brought into a time of ſtraits.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It's true, that through a mans whole life, <hi>Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> muſt be <hi>crucianus, he muſt take up his croſs that will follow the Lord: There's no ſon that he receives but he chvſtiſes.</hi> Affliction is a Childs portion in the ways of holyneſs; their correction is as truly from the hand of their father, as their proviſion is. But my purpoſe at preſent is to ſpeak of ſome ſpecial times of <hi>Jacobs trouble; a great day, a day of ſtraits:</hi> And God doth many times bring his own people unto this: It will appear to be true from all the dealings of God with the Saints; the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage in <hi>Aegypt</hi> long, and their affliction was great, but there was a time when the bricks were doubled, and the oppoſition heightned, ſo that they <hi>were as dead carrion caſt out to the Ravens,</hi> Gen. 15. And though Iſrael were hated of all the Nations, which God call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their <hi>evil neighbours,</hi> yet there were ſome ſpecial
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:115739:114"/> ſtraits that befell them, as in the dayes of <hi>Aſa,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14.9,10. <hi>When there came an Army of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopians, an hoſt of a thouſand thouſand men;</hi> and in the dayes of <hi>Hezckiah,</hi> when <hi>Senacherib beſieged Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, its a day of trouble, of rebuke, and of blaſphemy,</hi> Iſa. 37.3. But yet there was a time of greater ſtraits, when they muſt be carried into captivity, and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Lord removed from his own habitation. And the Goſpel was no ſooner placed in the world, but the great Red Dragon raiſed a perſecution; the Heathen Emperours, and all the Powers of their Empire, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.1,3. And that Power was no ſooner broken, and the Church obtained of God a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child, but immediately <hi>there was a flood caſt out after the woman;</hi> the <hi>Arrian</hi> Hereſie, and they perſecuted the Church more then the Pagans had done before; <hi>and then the Earth helped the Woman,</hi> &amp;c. Then doth Anti-chriſt ariſe, and the people of God do <hi>prophecie in ſackcloth and aſhes: Witneſſes</hi> they are, and <hi>two Witneſſes,</hi> for their paucity, and for their ſufficiency<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and yet there is a time of greater ſtraights that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains for them; there is <hi>the time of their fulfilling, and of their killing:</hi> ſo that God doth reſerve a time of ſtraits for his own people; <hi>theres a time of Jacobs trouble, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe the Lord will give unto them ſome eminent experiences of his providence, under which they walk; it's true that <hi>he is the Saviour of all men, but eſpecially of them that beleeve;</hi> and <hi>upon all the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry there is a covering at all times,</hi> Iſa. 4.5. but the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſtraits are, the more eminent ſhall the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction be; if <hi>Daniel be in the Lyons den, and the three children in the fiery furnace:</hi> the wonder had not been ſo great, <hi>if the bnſh had not been in the fire,</hi> but to ſee
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:115739:115"/> it in the fire, and yet not to conſume, that was the greateſt ſight that ever <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaw before. <hi>When the Earth is removed, and the Mountains caſt into the midſt of the ſea, then there is need of a Song upon Alamoth,</hi> pro occultis, <hi>for Gods hidden ones,</hi> Pſal. 46.1. <hi>If the Saints are in the pit in which there is nowater, now turn to your ſtrong holds ye priſoners of hope,</hi> ſatis praeſidii in uno Deo.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Satan being <hi>the God of this world,</hi> he doth alwaies rule the preſent world, which God hath redeemed the Saints from, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.4. And the <hi>children of diſobedience walk in the courſe of the preſent world:</hi> The world is caſt into variety of ſhapes, but into what form ſoever the preſent evil world is caſt into, Satan is the god of the world, and he doth apply himſelf to rule the world under all the forms into which the Lord doth caſt it. And therefore <hi>Hier om</hi> ſaith wel, <hi>Erras, mi frater, erras, ſi putas unquam Chriſtum perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutione non pati, &amp;c.</hi> If the world be Pagan, Satan rules in the great Red Dragon, and ſo brings the Saints into their time of ſtraits. If the face of the world change, and it turn Chriſtian, then Satan rules alſo in that, and caſts out <hi>a flood after the woman.</hi> If that Flood be dryed up, then Anti-chriſt doth ariſe, and he rules in him as a <hi>falſe Prophet;</hi> and afterwards, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1,2. If <hi>a form of godlineſs</hi> be brought in, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that he will rule, <hi>and men be lovers of their own ſelves, proud, boasters, treacherous, high minded, and deſpiſers of thoſe that are good;</hi> and therefore there muſt needs be ſtraits in all eſtates that ſhall await the Saints of God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the more ſpiritual light grows, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are the ſtraits that the people of <hi>God</hi> are brought into.</p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:115739:115"/>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe the more are their conſciences ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. It is not a cold Iron that will ſeare the Conſcience, but when there is evident, clear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing light, and men be told of it, and yet wil go againſt it, their Conſciences are ſeared by it, and in Judgement <hi>they are given over unto a reprobate mind.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the more they are exaſperated againſt the Truths of God, becauſe they do come nearer unto the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, which is the Devils ſin; and it doth conſiſt in malice upon a high and a rais'd light. No men were ſo cruel as the Phariſees, that did ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt; and therefore if <hi>prophecying in ſackcloth and aſhes</hi> would ſatisfie the luſts of men in times paſt, <hi>now killing</hi> is not ſufficient, but <hi>their dead bodies ſhall not be buried,</hi> to expreſs their former malice and rage againſt them; and therefore in the latter times, the ſtraits of the people of God muſt needs be greater then ever they have been in times paſt.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, God wil by this make way for an utter ruin of the Churches Enemies; the greater ſtraits they do bring the Saints into, the nearer is their deſtruction, and the ſooner will God ariſe. <hi>I have ſeen the affliction of my people that are in Aegypt, and I have heard their cry:</hi> For the Churches Enemies muſt periſh by the Churches hand, and therefore they are ſaid to be, <hi>a cup of trembling, and a burthe ſome ſtone:</hi> The Church brought that mighty people into a condition fit to be conſumed: <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was to them a cup of trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling; now they think to drink it off, and it proves their poyſon; and when they have brought them to extremity, that they thought all had been ſure, then they themſelves periſh: It's by the Churches ſtraits that the Enemies are ruin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Secondly, in what meaſure will the Lord do it?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, unto what end?</p>
                  <p>For the firſt: With what mind does the Lord bring his people into ſtraits? What are the thoughts of God towards them when he doth it?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he doth it from a principle of Love, and their Afflictions are grounded on the Second Covenant, as their Mercies are; other mens afflictions are from the Firſt Covenant, as a fruit of the Curſe, <hi>Mich.</hi> 7.9. the Church ſaies there, <hi>I will bear the indignation of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. Why is God in indignation with his own people? indeed <hi>he is angry with the wicked eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day.</hi> There is a double anger of God, <hi>ſimplex &amp; redundans in perſonam;</hi> he is angry at his peoples ſins, but yet he loves their perſons; and he afflicts them from a principle of <hi>faithfulneſs.</hi> Pſal. 119.75. For he hath covenanted to <hi>keep them from the evil of the world;</hi> he is to <hi>preſerve them unto his heavenly Kingdom;</hi> and he does, as I may ſay, ſometimetimes preſerve them in Salt, and ſomtimes in Sugar, as we uſe to doe with ſome things that we would preſerve.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God looks upon your ſuffering as the ſuffering of Chriſt; the Saints being one with him, their ſervices are Chriſts, and their ſufferings are Chriſts, <hi>they bear fruit in him, they live in him,</hi> Col.
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:115739:116"/> 1.24. So <hi>they fill up what is behind of the ſufferings of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, whilſt he doth ſmite them he is afflicted with them; <hi>in all their afflictions he is afflicted;</hi> though Chriſt be in heaven, yet he has the ſame nature there that he had here; and he ſtands in the ſame relation to us now he is in glory, that he did here, <hi>he is not aſhamed to call us brethren;</hi> and therefore his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion ſtill remains: <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.22 <hi>Since I ſpake againſt him, I remembred him ſtill: my bowels are troubled for him.</hi> The heart of God goes out unto all the Saints in their afflictions.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, whilſt he doth afflict them, <hi>he doth wait to be gracious,</hi> Iſa. 30.18. He doth not defer delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance becauſe he is not willing to beſtow it, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his people are not prepared for it, that's the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they are ſo long out of glory, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12. becauſe they are not yet <hi>meet to be partakers of the Inheritance with the Saints in life;</hi> and to make them ſo, he doth ſit by, <hi>as a Refiner, and he will only purge away their droſs</hi> by their afflictions.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, all the while they are in ſtraits, he doth take ſpecial notice of their ſufferings, and he is deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpleas'd with the Inſtruments that afflict his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and he is preparing for their ruin all the while; for he takes ſpecial notice of their wrong, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.2. <hi>I know thy work, and thy labour, and thy patience,</hi> &amp;c. Exo. 3.7. <hi>I know their ſorrows: He hath a bottle for their tears.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, he is deeply diſpleaſed with the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: <hi>Zach.</hi> 1.15. He ſent his people into <hi>Babylon,</hi> but yet, <hi>I am ſore diſpleaſed with the heathen; I was but a little diſpleaſed, and they helped forward the affliction.</hi> So that whilſt God doth uſe them as <hi>the rod of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> he is angry with them.</p>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:115739:117"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, he is all the while the Enemies are afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his people, preparing for their overthrow, <hi>Zac.</hi> 1.21,23. <hi>When he doth raiſe up horns, he doth provide Carpenters alſo.</hi> And Jeſus Chriſt all the while is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for to be his peoples reſcue, though they ſee him not, yet <hi>he is behind the Mirtle-trees at the bottom,</hi> Zach. 1.8.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, he will make their affliction to be the great means of their exaltation; <hi>Jacob ſhall ariſe when he is ſmall:</hi> The <hi>killing of the Witneſses made way for their Reſurrection,</hi> the more glorious. Theſe are the thoughts and the mind of God towards <hi>Jacob</hi> in the day of his trouble.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in what meaſure will he do this? <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.11. <hi>I will correct thee in meaſure, but not leave thee altogether unpuniſh'd:</hi> And here conſider theſe five particulars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it ſhall not be according to the deſert of your ſins, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.13. <hi>I have puniſhed you leſſe then your ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities deſerve: He will not ſtir up all his wrath,</hi> Pſalm 28.38. <hi>It's the Lords mercy we are not conſumed.</hi> We might have been in Hel as well as in <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, it ſhall be but according to the meaſure of your neceſſities: He doth afflict but <hi>when need is,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.6. And it ſhall be no farther than need is, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.24. <hi>He will not alwayes be ploughing;</hi> there is a ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time, ſo much breaking of the ground as wil pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it for the ſeed, and no more.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it ſhall be proportionable to a mans place in the myſtical body of Chriſt: There are ſome veſſels of Gold, and ſome of Silver, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.20,21. <hi>Chriſt the head was the firſt born amongſt many brethren,</hi> Rom. 8.29. And as all the brethren are not called forth to the like eminent ſervices, ſo all are not called to the like eminent ſufferings.</p>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:115739:117"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, it ſhall be proportionable to their ſtrength, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. <hi>He will not ſuffer us to be tempted above what we are able:</hi> and he will give in ſupplies of graces ſuitable unto the ſuffering, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. <hi>My grace is ſufficient,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.27. <hi>He doth not turn the cart wheele on all the Corn, but he hath a staffe for the fitches, and a rod for the cummin,</hi> &amp;c. He takes meaſure of your graces, of your ſpirits, and of your ſtrength, and he doth give it unto you proportionable to your need.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, there are alwaies ſome mitigating circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that do abate and ſweeten the affliction; <hi>non dantur purae tenebrae, there is a light between the peeces,</hi> Gen. 15.17.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, God doth ſometimes give them favour in the eyes of their enemies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.6.96. he made them to pitty them that carried them captive. <hi>Joſeph ſhall find favour with the Keeper of the priſon,</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> with <hi>the chiefeſt of the Eunuchs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, what is wanting in outward bleſſings, he will make up to them inſpiritual ordinances; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 20.20. <hi>Though he doth feed them with the bread of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, and the water of trouble, yet their eyes ſhall ſee their Teachers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if they have none of theſe yet they ſhall have his gracious preſence with them inlarging of their hearts; that <hi>with Paul and Silas they ſhall ſing in a priſon,</hi> and be able to ſay, <hi>it was good for me that I was afflicted:</hi> As one of the Martyrs ſayd, <hi>I was in priſon till I came into priſon;</hi> nil crus ſentit in nervo, dum animus eſt in coelo.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, unto what end doth the Lord do this? Every wiſe Agent works for an end, and the more wiſdom he hath, the higher ends he aims at in every
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:115739:118"/> action, and the more ends he doth make to meet in every thing that he doth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.18. <hi>The Lord is a God of Judgement:</hi> It's there put for Wiſdom: <hi>He orders and moderates all things,</hi> in reference unto the end that he doth aim at; and as the Lord in all his waies <hi>is wonderful in wiſdom and counſel;</hi> ſo he is in all the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of the Saints; there is much wiſdom ſeen in his high ends, that he has in afflicting his people, and in making many ends to meet. I'll name four great ends.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Lord doth bring his people to ſtraits, to prevent ſin.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the riſing of luſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. <hi>that I might not be exalted,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The acting of luſt if it doth ariſe, <hi>Job</hi> 33.17. <hi>He doth chastiſe a man with ſtrong pain, it is to keep man from his purpoſe, and to hide pride from his eyes:</hi> When he hath taken up an evil purpoſe, there is a croſs inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth, <hi>interactum primum &amp; ſecundum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. For the finiſhing of ſin, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.6,7. <hi>He hedg'd up their way;</hi> they were going on in it, but God doth put a ſtop in their way, as men do to beaſts, their way is hedg'd up.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Lord doth bring his people to ſtraits for their Inſtruction, <hi>Mich.</hi> 6.9. <hi>There's not a rod but it hath a voice.</hi> Beaſts feel the rod, but the Saints they hear it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God does it, to let them ſee the evil of ſin; for <hi>a man is held with the cords of his own ſin,</hi> Prov. 5.22. Ezek. 7.10. <hi>As pride doth bud, ſo doth the rod bloſsom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. God doth it to let them ſee the emptineſs of the creature, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. <hi>I rejoice in the croſs of Chriſt, for by it the world is crucifyed unto me, and I unto the world:</hi> He was thereby enabled to look upon the world as a
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:115739:118"/> crucified thing, that they may ſee they are <hi>but ſtrangers and pilgrims,</hi> and therefore <hi>ſhould ſeek a country,</hi> and haſten home.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To let them know what it is <hi>to have fellowſhip with the ſuffering of Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 3.10. There's a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of the ſufferings of Chriſt, that the Saints deſire to know experimentally in themſelves; that as Chriſt was ſupported under ſuffering, ſo may they; and as he was <hi>perfected by ſuffering,</hi> ſo may they alſo be; <hi>for he did in ſuffering leave himſelf an example,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.21. as well as in dying.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, for their ſanctification.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To purge their corruption; <hi>the bundle of folly the rod of correction muſt drive out,</hi> Zach. 13,8,9. <hi>Two parts ſhall be cut off and dye, and the third part ſhall paſse through the fire, to refine them as ſilver, and they ſhall call upon my name, and I will hear them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. To improve their Graces; for he doth it to <hi>make them partakers of his holyneſs,</hi> Heb. 12.10. And he will do it in a higher way, by a croſs ſometimes, then by an ordinance he will make the way foul, and the ſoul fruitful, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.3.4. <hi>Tribulation works pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and patience experience, and experience hope,</hi> &amp;c. There's a ſweet influence in theſe ſhowres of affliction that ripen the graces of the Saints.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it's to prepare them for ſervices, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.5,6. <hi>He comforted us in all our tribulation, that we might be able to comfort others with the ſame conſolation.</hi> 1 King. 4.31. Heman <hi>is counted one of the wiſeſt men of the world,</hi> and in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 88. we ſee how he attained it, by being <hi>train'd up in the ſchool of affliction;</hi> and God doth caſt ſome men into great afflictions, that thereby he may fit them for high and eminent ſervices after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: <hi>Joſeph</hi> had never been ſo fit to have been a
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:115739:119"/> Governour in <hi>Egypt,</hi> if his foot had not been hurt in the ſtocks; nor <hi>Moſes</hi> to have been a leader of the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> if he had not been banſhed forty yeares in the Wilderneſs; and <hi>David</hi> his Crown had never ſate ſo well, if he had not been <hi>hunted as a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge upon the mountains.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, that the Lord may have ſome to give their teſtimonies unto his truth; that it may appear, that there are ſome that do ſtand for God, and dare appear for him; <hi>when the world wonder'd after the Beaſt, there are ſome that ſtand with the Lamb upon mount Zion,</hi> Rev. 14.2. <hi>There are two Witneſſes.</hi> The Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of God are but a few, yet ſome there are that God will raiſe up in all Ages, ſo that corruption in Doctrine and Worſhip ſhal not go unteſtified againſt; for the Lord will not leave the world without witneſs; and hereby the Lord will endear his Witneſſes, and raiſe them up in the hearts of the Saints, it will make them dear, and their names precious in the Churches, for none have been ſo precious in their names as they that did not count their blood precious, they thought not their lives dear to them, they loved not their lives to the death: How precious was <hi>Peter</hi> in his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering? When all the Church ingaged their intereſt unto God for him, <hi>Acts</hi> 12. As Roſes are ſweeter in the Still then upon the ſtalk, ſo it is with the Saints in all their ſufferings in the apprehenſion of the Churches.</p>

                  <p>Is it ſo, that there is a day of trouble to <hi>Jacob?</hi> Then do you look for a day of trouble alſo, and to that end it's your wiſdom to diſcern the ſigns of the times, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.3.

                  <p>Firſt, antient Predictions.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, preſent Diſpenſations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Antient Predictions, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.7. <hi>cum finituis ſint,</hi> when they were about to finiſh: The 1260 daies are not yeares fulfilled; therefore the killing time is to come; for the Beaſt receives his Kingdom with the ſeven Kings ſince the <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                  <p n="2">2. There was never yet that perfect Victory, that <hi>they did ſay, they are dead;</hi> there were none that did viſibly appear to bear witneſs againſt them, therefore it is yet to come.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, preſent diſpenſations compared with the rules of the Word.</p>
                  <p>Firſt when there's a general decay of Wiſdom in Rulers, and <hi>children and babes rule over a people,</hi> Iſa. 27.14. <hi>I will do a marvellous work, the wiſdom of the wiſe men ſhall periſh, and now I will diſtreſs</hi> Ariel.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when there is poured out upon a people <hi>the ſpirit of a deep ſleep,</hi> as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.10. that nothing could awaken them, but as men ſleeping upon the top of a Maſt, though the Sea roar, and the Wind make a noiſe, yet they ſleep ſtil; when men are ſecure, then <hi>the diſtreſs of Ariel is near; I will ſearch Jeruſalem with candles,</hi> and <hi>the men that are ſetled upon their Lees,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, when there is a general oppreſſion and mercileſneſs in the Rulers, <hi>Zac.</hi> 11.5. <hi>When a people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the flock of the ſlaughter,</hi> Mic. 7.3,4. <hi>the Judge asketh for a reward:</hi> now ſhall be their perplexity.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, when there are general neglects of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and order amongſt a people, <hi>every one does whats right in his own eyes, when the baſe doth preſume a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

               <p>And he gives the reaſon of this exhortation.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe it is a <hi>depoſitum,</hi> that the Lord hath in
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:115739:123"/> mercy delivered unto the Saints, <note place="margin">Rom. 3.2.</note> which the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires them to keep: You are but Stewards of it, it is committed unto you, that you ſhould tranſmit it unto poſterity.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it was but <hi>once given,</hi> and therefore you cannot expect, that if you part with it, the Lord will again beſtow it unto you: It's like the fire upon the Altar, that was at firſt kindled from heaven, and was there by the induſtry of the Prieſts to be kept alive, and was never to go out; it was but once given, it was Gods free Grace to beſtow it, and he doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that it ſhould be our care and work to preſerve it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he doth preſs this from the danger of it, in regard that the enemies lye in wait, there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain men crept in unawares, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt falſe Teachers; they doe not ruſh in, for then they would be obſerved, but they creep in ſecretly, and in an unobſerved manner, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. <hi>A beaſt riſing out of the earth:</hi> There's a temporal power of the Pope; for he is repreſented under a double viſion, of two Beaſts.</p>
               <p>Firſt, a Beaſt with ſeven heads, and ten horns, that is, he did claim a power over the ten Kings to depoſe them, and releaſe their ſubjects from obedience unto them; and this was a power that the ten Kings did give unto him, and this <hi>did ariſe out of the Sea,</hi> from the wars, and trouble, and commotions that were in the world: But there is another deſcription of the Pope, as he is the <hi>falſe Prophet,</hi> which relates unto the Eccleſiaſtical power, that he takes to himſelf; and ſo <hi>he hath two horns,</hi> one as a <hi>Lamb,</hi> an embleme of Meekneſſe and Innocency, and he <hi>ariſeth out of the earth,</hi> that is, <hi>ſtirpium more,</hi> as things doe
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:115739:123"/> grow out of the earth in a ſecret and unobſerved way.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the thing that they trade in, is the Truths of God, and the ſouls of men; <hi>therefore contend ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly for the Faith;</hi> for when falſe Teachers come, it is the Faith that they do mainly aim at, and Satan is the grand deceiver in them.</p>
               <p>And the Apoſtle comes alſo to a deſcription of the perſons with whom your contention was to be.</p>
               <p>Firſt, they are deſcribed by the act of God upon them, what they are in Gods Predetermination.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by the act of ſin within them, and what they are by their own corruptions.</p>
               <p>Firſt, by the act of God upon them; <hi>they were of old ordained to deſtruction.</hi> The Greek word is, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

It is unto this damnation that they are appointed: And ſome read the words, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>ad hoc judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um;</hi> for to be given over into ſuch a way of ſinning, it's the greateſt ſpiritual judgement that can befall a man in this life, and doth flow from a ſentence and a decree paſſed upon him by God; for he that hath ordain'd men unto damnation, hath by a permiſſive (though not an effective will) appointed alſo the means by which he ſhall come unto that end, that ſo he is ordain'd to be damn'd.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by the power of ſin within them: All ungodly men, pretend what they will, <hi>they have no fear of God in them,</hi> nor any reſpect unto God, they are men that are <hi>ſtrangers unto God,</hi> and <hi>live without him in the world,</hi> that's their generall deſcription; they are <hi>ungodly men that have no feare of God in their hearts,</hi>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:115739:124"/> and that do whatſoever they do, without any reſpect unto God, though they are many times great preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, yet of them all it's ſaid, that <hi>their God is their beily,</hi> and all that they doe is for ſome low end; it's with no reſpect unto God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they are more particularly deſcrib'd.</p>
               <p>Firſt, by their deſperate opinions; <hi>they turn the grace of God into wantonneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, by their devilliſh converſations; <hi>They deny the Lord God, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> it's ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in reſpect of their lives and wayes: 2 <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.16. <hi>They profeſs they know God, but in works they deny him,</hi> &amp;c. And we ſhall ever find, that monſtrous opinions are ever accompanied with monſtrous corruptions.</p>
               <p>It's the deſcription of theſe men according unto their wicked opinions that I am to ſpeak of at preſent, and there are in the words three things to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd.</p>
               <p>Firſt, what is meant by the Grace of God?</p>
               <p>Secondly, what is meant by Wantonneſs?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, what it is to turn this Grace into Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, what is meant by the Grace of God? As given unto us, Grace is taken two waies in Scripture, either for the Goſpel, <hi>the Word of his Grace,</hi> as it is called <hi>Acts</hi> 20.32. and ſo it is taken 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1. <hi>We as workers together with him, doe beſeech you not to receive the grace of God in vain.</hi> It's ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the Doctrine of the Goſpel, which the Lord had ſent amongſt them; and <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11. <hi>The Grace of God that bringeth ſalvation hath appear'd to all men,</hi> &amp;c. It's ſpoken of the Doctrin of the Goſpel, <hi>the Word of his grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, it's put for the impreſs of this Word up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:115739:124"/> the heart; for it's <hi>the word writ in the heart;</hi> they are the habits of Grace in us, it is <hi>into this mould we are caſt,</hi> Rom 6.17. and it is <hi>by looking into this Glaſs that we are transformed,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Cor. 3. laſt v. <hi>It's the Word ingrafted</hi> that doth change the man: <note place="margin">Jam. 1.21.</note> And ſo we are ſaid to <hi>receive from Chriſt Grace for Grace,</hi> Joh. 1.16. <hi>The unction in us</hi> being anſwerable to that of thoſe that are in Chriſt; and that <hi>gratia habitualis</hi> in us, anſwering that which was in Chriſts humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for he had the ſame ſpirit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, what is it to turn the Grace of God into Wantonneſs? The word is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>on carried away by another Goſpel?</hi> The falſe Teachers had tranſlated them, and put them from their ſtation, in which beleefe they ſtood before they removed them from it; and ſo when <hi>the doctrine of the Grace of God, that did teach men to deny un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs and worldly luſts, and was given to make the man of perfect unto every good work,</hi> when this grace is by the luſts of men perverted to a quite contrary end, this is to tranſlate the grace of God to another end, then that for which the Lord appointed it, when men do father their luſts upon the Word of God, and bear them up by it; and this has always been the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of a I fal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Fiftly, the people of God have abhorr'd them
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:115739:127"/> as the wickedeſt men that ever were in the world, and therefore there is no ſort of ſinners that the Spirit of God hath ſo ſet himſelf, and the Spirit of his Saints ſo much againſt, as theſe; <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.10. <hi>A heretick reject,</hi> &amp;c.

And it appears to bee a highway of wickedneſs, and that which brings all others with it, becauſe Satan did put more confidence in it, then by any other way to carry on his deſign; and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:115739:127"/> when he was not able to uphold his power any longer in a way of perſecution, as he did in the firſt three hundred yeares, now he thinkes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire all by a way of Hereſie; for let Chriſt caſt the world into what ſhape he will, Satan ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes himſelf unto that ſhape, that ſo he may be <hi>the ruler of the darkneſs of it,</hi> &amp;c. Now there being a great influence from Hell upon this; and Satan putting a greater confidence in it, it doth plainly ſhew, that there are more depths of wickedneſſe in this than in any other way of ſinning whatſoever, and it muſt needs be, if wee conſider with our ſelves theſe three things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Underſtanding is the leading fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and therein are layd down the rules for the whole life. In the practical underſtanding that is the common treaſury of all the rules of practice, and according unto theſe a mans whole life is formed; corrupt but the principals of a man, and his whole life will quickly be corrupt; for no man is better than his principles, neither can he be: There's many a man would be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter if he had higher principles; and therefore the Lord when he ſhews mercy to a man, and doth increaſe his Grace, he doth uſually raiſe his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and then as a mans light doth riſe, his Graces will increaſe; for it is <hi>claritas in intellectu parit,</hi> and every man will ſtrive to live up to his principles; a godly man doth, and he blaming himſelfe that he doth fall ſhort; and a wicked man ſhall daily be put upon it, and therefore many of them, they cannot be ſo wicked as their
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:115739:128"/> principles would lead them to; they ſee there is ſo much fleſh in them, that they cannot yet bring themſelves to be perſwaded, that there is no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the dead, nor no life after this life, no puniſhments nor rewards; but <hi>if the eye be darkneſſe, how great is that darkneſs?</hi> By the Eye is meant the Underſtanding, or the practical Judgement, which is the guide of a mans way, as the Eye in the body is, and if that be darkned in the principles of it, the whole body, the whole life muſt needs be full of darkneſſe; the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the Eye cauſeth a darkneſſe all the body over.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it muſt needs be ſo, becauſe this takes away whatever ſhould reſtraine the luſts of men; for there is <hi>a ſea of corruption in the heart,</hi> Iſa. 57.20. As the raging Sea, onely there are bounds ſet to it, and what is that but the light that God doth put into their conſciences; and men are overawed by it, they cannot be ſo wicked as they would; now if luſt can once by a corrupt Doctrine caſt off this bridle, what kind of evill can they be withheld from?

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N theſe words are four things to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered. Firſt here's a godly man deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in his life, and that either in reſpect of his inward diſpoſition, or his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward converſation. In his diſpoſition of ſoul, hee is a <hi>Righteous man</hi> and a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful man alſo. A <hi>Righteous man</hi>] hee had need have good eyes that finds out ſuch a one; for <hi>Pſal.</hi> 53.4. <hi>The Lord looked down from Heaven upon the children
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:115739:133"/> of men, and he found none righteous.</hi> Indeed in a legall ſence there is none, but hath an allay in a Goſpel ſence, there is arighteouſneſs that is imputed upon juſtification, and there is a new image infuſed upon ſanctification; and both theſe muſt concur in the righteous man, and the merciful man, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the man of mercy who hath attained mercy himſelf, and who is ready to ſhew mercy unto others. <hi>The ſpirit of God came down in the likeneſs of a Dove.</hi> A Dove as it is without guile, ſo is it without gall alſo; and a righteous man is not only thus within, but in his converſation, <hi>his light ſhines before men, he is alwayes walking in his uprightneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, In his death, and ſo he is ſaid to periſh, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the word in the Hebrew is either put for temporall or eternal death. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.16. <hi>that they ſhould not periſh but have everlas;ting life,</hi> but here it's meant of temporal death, the diſunion between the Soul and the Body, and ſo to periſh is to dye, <hi>Matth</hi> 8.25. <hi>Maſter ſave us, elſe we periſh.</hi> And it's ſaid alſo they are taken away, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>in unum colligere:</hi> They are gathered unto their Fathers: here in this world they are ſcattered, and ſome live in one place, &amp; ſome in another, but death is a gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; &amp; there is <hi>faſciculus viventium even a bundle of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving:</hi> as the <hi>tares are bound in bundles</hi> ſo is the wheat alſo.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, After his death: the Soul in this life is full of trouble: here in this life but a little peace enters into him, <hi>my peace I give unto you,</hi> but, then after this life he ſhall enter into peace; here, a little joy enters into him, but then <hi>he ſhall enter into the Maſters joy,</hi> for ever: and for their bodys, they ſhall reſt in their beds, as the grave is commonly called: it <hi>being the ſweet ſleeping place,</hi> as 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.14. it is ſaid of <hi>Aſa that he ſlept with his Fathers; and they buried him in his own Sepulcher,</hi> and laid him in a bed which was filled with ſweet odors <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:115739:133"/>
               <p>Secondly, Here is a publick loſs bewailed, <hi>the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous periſh, and there is no man that doth apponere cor.</hi> Mich. 7.1. <hi>woe is me for I am as the Summer-gatherings; the good man is periſhed out of the Earth,</hi> the taking away of the godly is the great loſs and matter of great mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning unto thoſe that ſurvive.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Here is a publick and a common evil repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the fooliſh and unthankful world is no whit affected with the loſs of thoſe of whom the Lord ſays, <hi>the world was not worthy of:</hi> and this want of affection is grounded upon the want of conſideration, <hi>no man lays it to heart, no man underſtood that they were taken away from the evil to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Here is a ſecret of providence diſcovered: godly men are taken away, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

               <p>That I ſhould ſpeak unto al theſe, cannot be expected at this time; there are only three points that I <hi>ſhall</hi> pick out of them all.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Godly men dye not as other men doe: it is peculiar unto them, <hi>to enter into peace, and</hi> reſt in their bed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Godly men are uſually taken away in <hi>mercy,</hi> before an evil come.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, When they are taken away, it ſhould be unto them that ſurvive, matter of ſerious Conſideration, Affliction, and Lamentation.</p>
               <p>Firſt, This is made the peculiar portion of the righteous and mercifull men, at <hi>their death, they ſhall enter into peace.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Godly men dye not as others doe;</hi> there's a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between them, and others in their death.</p>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:115739:134"/>
                  <p>There is indeed a great deale of difference between men in their lives: they are <hi>men of another ſpirit, of another generation,</hi> they walk by other principles, they aim at other ends, they live upon other comforts then others doe, and therefore they are men of another value, and eſteem, <hi>they are the excellent ones;</hi> when the greateſt amongſt men (if they be wicked) are <hi>vile perſons,</hi> they are amongſt men, as gold amongſt the duſt of the Earth, and as diamonds amongſt the common pebles in the ſtreets.</p>
                  <p>But the great and the grand difference between them is in their deaths, there is ſomething in a ſpecial maner in death peculiar to the Saints, and this we are ſpecially to obſerve. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.37. <hi>the end of that man is peace:</hi> this <hi>Balaam</hi> could obſerve <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.10. There is a death peculi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r to the righteous, <hi>Proverbs</hi> 14.32. <hi>The wicked ſhall be caſt away in his wickedneſs, but the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hath hope in his death:</hi> The oppoſition ſhews the difference. When a godly man ſhall be gathered, a wicked man ſhal be deſtroyed, caſt away; and when the godly man dyes, he dyes in hope, but the wicked man at death he breaths <hi>out his ſoul,</hi> his life, and hope together.</p>
                  <p>But ſeeing they do both dye, the righteous man as well as the wicked; we ſee alſo that wiſe men dye as well as <hi>thoſe</hi> that are fooliſh: and for the manner of their death, to outward view there is a great reſemblance: <hi>Eccles.</hi> 2.16. <hi>as dyes the fool, ſo alſo dies the wiſe man:</hi> yet there is a great difference; <hi>Ahab, and Ioſiah,</hi> a wicked, and a gracious King, they both dyed &amp; for the manner of their deaths, it was much alike, they dyed both in War, with the ſame words in their mouthes, <hi>turn thy hand for I am wounded;</hi> and yet its ſaid of the one, <hi>he dyed and was gathered to his fathers in peace,</hi> though he dyed in War. What is therefore in death that is peculiar to the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:115739:134"/> Saints? how dyes <hi>the wiſe man?</hi> this will be ſeen in three things. <hi>Firſt, in</hi> reſpect of the perſons dying, <hi>Secondly</hi> in reſpect of death it ſelf, <hi>Thirdly in</hi> reſpect of the fruit and the conſequence of death.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In reference unto the perſon dying, for a <hi>godly man dyes in the Lord.</hi> Rev. 14.13. <hi>he doth ſleep in Ieſus,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.18. which implies two things. Firſt an union with him, a being in him,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, A dying in him, by the power and efficacy of the ſame union: now we doe not only reade in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of our <hi>being in Chriſt,</hi> but alſo <hi>living in him, working in him, bearing fruit in him &amp;c.</hi> Now a man doth live in Chriſt, when by the Almighty working of the Spirit of Chriſt the Graces of Chriſt appeare in him, and he lives no more, according to Men in the Fleſh, but according to God in the Spirit: ſo we are ſaid to die in him, when by the Power of the Spirit of Chriſt, by vertue of our union with him, we do exerciſe theſe dying graces that were in Chriſt; for their be in him living, and dying, doing, and ſuffering graces; and when by vertue of our Union <hi>living by the faith of the ſon of God,</hi> a man doth exerciſe theſe Graces, then is a man ſaid <hi>to dye in Chriſt, work in him, ſuffer in him, live in him;</hi> ſo <hi>that a godly man dies in the Lord,</hi> he is one with him, and even in death, the Myſtical union is not diſſolved, and the dying graces that were in Chriſt, and which a Saint doth receive by vertue of union with him, thoſe graces he doth <hi>exerciſe as Chriſt</hi> doth, for <hi>he dies in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>He dies in Faith,</hi> Firſt <hi>in reſpect of himſelf;</hi> he beleeves that death ſhall be unto him a bleſſing, and not a curſe: 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.23. <hi>all things are yours</hi> (that is) <hi>in ordine ad ſpiritualia,</hi> whether life or death, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</hi>
                     <pb n="214" facs="tcp:115739:135"/> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. <hi>We know, that if this Earthly houſe of our Tabernacle were diſolved, we have a building with God &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And towards the time of a Saints death, Faith com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly puts forth the moſt glorious acts, the Sun ſhines brighteſt at its ſetting: ſo that the ſoul can ſay with <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe, nec pudet vivere, nec piget mori,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>2 <hi>In reſpect of the Church:</hi> though he never lives to receave the promiſes, nor to ſee them accompliſhed, yet as they have exerciſed faith upon the great things promiſed, and have laid up prayers for after times, ſo they dye in the faith of them, that they ſhall be fulfilled in their ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.23. <hi>God will ſurely viſit you, ſaith Joſeph:</hi> and therefore what difficulties ſoever they ſee rais'd againſt it, yea the Archers ſhoot at the Church, yet <hi>his bow abode in ſtrength,</hi> his faith holds out, and can look through all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>3 <hi>For their poſterity:</hi> Men are commonly troubled, what ſhall become of the little ones they leave behind fatherleſs and friendleſs Orphans: but his fatherleſs chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren he can leave with God, and the widow that truſts in God ſhal not be forſaken: although my houſe be not ſo with God, yet <hi>he hath made with me an everlaſting covenant, ordered in all things and ſure,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luther</hi> in his Will ſays, Lord thou haſt given me wife and children. I have neither Land to bequeath them, nor houſes, nor portions to leave them: onely <hi>tibi reddo, nutri, doce, ſerva, ut hactenus me, pater pupillorum, &amp; judex viduarum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>The dye in obedience to God:</hi> Obedience is not real, if it be not univerſal; a ſubmiſſion to the will of God in doing as well as ſuffering; in dying, as well as in living: <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.8. <hi>None of us lives to himſelf, nor none of us dyes to himſelf: but whether we live, we live unto the Lord; or whether we dye, we dye unto the Lord;</hi> for
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:115739:135"/> grace having made God a mans utmoſt end, it is his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and a ſubmiſſion unto his will, that is the great th ing in that mans eye, whether in living, or in dying: if God will further uſe him, he is content to live; and if the Lord will tranſlate him, he deſires to dye; and ſo God may be glorifyed in him whether in life or death, he paſſeth not: and when he hath honored God in his life, he deſires that he may honor God in <hi>his death</hi> alſo.</p>
                  <p>2 <hi>In reference unto death it ſelf:</hi> and ſo there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing peculiar to the <hi>death</hi> of the Saints: take theſe three things:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Though death in it ſelf be a fruit of the Curſe, yet unto him it is turned into a bleſſing; though it be a curſe in the thing, yet it is a bleſſing to the man; becauſe he having his Covenant changed, he is delivered from the Curſe, <hi>Chriſt being made a curſe for him:</hi> A <hi>Curſe</hi> hath two things in it:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, ſomething that is evil in it ſelf:</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The wrath of God therein.</p>
                  <p>Now unto the Saints death is not evil, and therefore they have deſired it: <hi>I long to be diſſolved and to be with Chriſt,</hi> neither is it a fruit of Gods diſpleaſure to them, but it flows from his fatherly, and eternal love, that it may be a paſſage unto a better life; whereas all other men dye by vertue of that ancient Curſe; <hi>The day thou eateſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of thou ſhalt dye,</hi> and <hi>in death the wrath of God abides up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Unto the Saints <hi>death hath no ſting</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55. Death is compared to a Serpent, which by nature we fear, and flye from, and the thing that is dreadful in it is the ſting: but if that be taken out, there is no fear of the ſerpent now <hi>the ſting of death is ſin;</hi> and this is taken off by the ſurety, 2 Cor. 5.21. <hi>for he hath made him to be ſin for us;</hi> and therefore there is no ſin ſtands upon our
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:115739:136"/> ſcore, that ſhould cauſe us to fear the ſerpent for ever: but other men <hi>dye in their ſins,</hi> Joh. 8.21. and have all their ſins to anſwer for before the judgement ſeat of Chriſt; and not a drop of his blood ſhall take one of them off his ſcore.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Over the Saints death hath no dominion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.14. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Now what is it that doth conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute death in dominion? that is, when it can put forth its utmoſt power, and there is none to control it, but there comes upon a man, <hi>quicquid mortis eſt uſ<expan>
                           <am>
                              <g ref="char:abque"/>
                           </am>
                           <ex>que</ex>
                        </expan> ad noviſsimum,</hi> it hath a power to keep them under for ever; but unto the Saints the dominion of death is controlled; for <hi>death entred by ſin, and it reigns by it:</hi> therefore when the dominion of ſin is broken, the dominion of death is alſo ſo; and the Saints are freed from the dominion of him that (as an executioner) <hi>hath the power of death,</hi> that is, <hi>the devil,</hi> Heb. 2.15. Pſal. 49.14. but for wicked men, death ſhall feed on them, and there is none to deliver them; but for <hi>the Saints, the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt them. I know that there is a</hi> Dalile interpretation commonly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and received from that ſcripture, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. Firſt, gates is put for the power of hell, becauſe the ſtrength of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties was in their gates; but ſurely, this ſeems not to be the meaning, for by gates of hell is meant that power which ſhould oppoſe the Church, and ſurely gates by their ſtrength might be for defence unto them, but not for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: unto them without they were <hi>propugnacula, non <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ppugnacula,</hi> they did not fight with gates. Secondly, Anciently Councils did uſually ſit in the gates, and ſo it ſignifies all the council and the policy of hell, but that alſo ſeems not well to agree with the word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> here uſed, which ſignifies to prevail and overcome by power, not by policy; by ſtrength, and not by art: but that which prevails moſt with me, is, that our Divines have commonly
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:115739:136"/> aſſerted againſt the local diſtance, that <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is never put for Hell, or the place of the damned, but either for the grave, or the ſtate and condition of the dead: and if that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e true, then we read of <hi>the gates of the grave,</hi> Job 38 17. Iſai. 38.10. <hi>of the power of the grave;</hi> to keep <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>—3 He was a man in all his relations of a very pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik ſpirit; he was far from making thoſe private advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages to himſelf, that many do of kindred and friends; he was one had impoveriſht himſelf for the publick ſervice, to my knowledge, and never ſought, and profeſs'd ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver would, recompence from the State.—Many men will ſerve the kingdom whilſt they ſerve themſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; and the while they ſerve the State, they have wrought well for themſelves: <hi>dives poteſtas pauperem facit Rem-publicam.</hi>

                  <p>4 He was a man very humble, of a meek, and a ſweet temper; free from the common bitterneſs that is in men; he had much of the Dove, and of dovelike ſimplicity; and much of the wiſdom, though very free from the craft of the Serpent; a man full of ſweetneſs and love: of an amiable and a winning converſation, which ſurely are things, <hi>in the ſight of God in great price.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5 He was a man of a very faithful ſpirit; which truely now is very hard to finde. We may well ſay, <hi>the faithful man is periſhed;</hi> falſhood is now grown the wiſdom, and the policy of the times; for men to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend grace, and intend nothing leſs; to look one way, and row another; to <hi>ſpeak words ſmoother then butter,</hi> when <hi>they have war in their hearts,</hi> and <hi>to betray his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a kiſs,</hi> and <hi>with Ioab ſtab him in an imbrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> and he that can carry it with the greateſt fairneſs and ſmoothneſs, is the wiſeſt man; and this is the great policy of our times.</p>

                  <p>6 Laſtly, He was (and I wiſh all that are in places of truſt would conſider this) exceeding induſtrious and active in the care of the publick: much lay upon him, he did not ſpare his pains, and his time, even to the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of his own neceſſary affairs; yea, the neceſſity of nature, for a ſupport of nature many a time, as I can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and the ſad condition of the kingdom lay very heavy upon him; he was willing to his power, to put men a work, ere he had wages for them, from the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick: Many men are active, but it is, when there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be gotten, that does oyl their Chariot wheeles; <hi>they love to tread out the Corn,</hi> but to plow in hope; and to labour barely for the publick good.

                  <p>Thirdly, If you forſake Him, He will forſake you.</p>
                  <p>Here is a Doctrinal Propoſition, with a particular Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication; the Propoſition is this, That they that do forſake God ſhall be forſaken of God. 2 The Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, that if ye forſake God, he will alſo forſake you, that he hath ſo gloriouſly delivered, and for whom he hath ſo eminently appeared, <hi>riding upon the heavens, and his excellency on the skye, yet if he will turn his hand and conſume you after he has done you good;</hi> this is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o periſh with a double deſtruction: as, for a man to dye
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:115739:145"/> after he hath had ſome quickning works upon him, is <hi>to be twice dead:</hi> ſo, for a man or a people to periſh or be deſtroyed after the Lord hath done them good, and ſeemed to rejoyce over them, this is to periſh with a double deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>For the opening of this Doctrine, there are four things in the Text, which are to be conſidered. Firſt we ſee, that the deſertion of a people never begins in God; the Lord doth not forſake them, till they forſake him. There are two ſorts of acts that God exerciſes over men; ſome <hi>Actus dominii,</hi> acts of ſoveraignty: Secondly, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus juſtitiae:</hi> the one reſpects men as creatures, the other reſpects men as ſinners.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Preterition,</hi> is an act of ſoveraignty, and that begins in God: but deſertion is an act of Juſtice; and therefore muſt begin in us: for the cauſe of all puniſhment, the meritorious cauſe, is to be found in the creature; and doth begin in us, and not in him. Its true, that all acts of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy do begin in God; and they have no ground in the creature: <hi>he loves us firſt,</hi> he ſhews mercy freely, and what ever he doth it is for his <hi>own ſake,</hi> there is nothing in the creature that procures it. The riſe and foundation of mercy is in himſelf; but acts of Juſtice have their riſe from us: for he doth in all judgements cleer this unto the creature, that <hi>he doth not without cauſe any thing that he hath done:</hi> and the Lord ſaith of all judgements, haſt thou not procured it to thy ſelf? is not this the wages that you have wrought, and laboured for? is not this the harveſt which anſwers the ſeed that you have ſowen? for <hi>they that ſow to the fleſh, ſhall of the fleſh reap corruption,</hi> &amp;c. So that the Lord doth never reject us till we reject him; he doth never forſake us till we forſake him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. <hi>the wages of ſin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life:</hi> but acts of grace begin in
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:115739:146"/> God, and they are meer gifts, but all acts of Juſtice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin in us, and are but the fruits of our own deſervings: he rejects us becauſe we reject him firſt, &amp;c. Secondly it may be ſuppoſed that they that have had the Lord much with them, and have had great and eminent expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of his preſence going with them, yet they may forſake the Lord and depart from him; <hi>Iſrael</hi> did ſo, <hi>they forgat God their ſaviour who had done great things for them in Egypt, wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red ſea,</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.6,21,22. and they that forget God will quickly forſake God: a people may ariſe unto that fooliſh confidence in their own preſent condition, that they may ſay, <hi>Ier.</hi> 2.31. <hi>We are Lords, we will come no more at thee:</hi> a ſtrange expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion! and they may walk towards God, as if they were put into ſuch an eſtate, that they ſhould now need God no more; but that they could live without him: we have now no more need of faſting and praying; days of humiliation may now be intermitted, for not onely months, but yeers together. What is this but for a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to ſay. <hi>We are Lords, we will come no more at thee;</hi> we have not now the ſame need of God that we had in times paſt: 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.15. <hi>Vzziah was marvellouſly helped till he was ſtrong:</hi> but when he was ſtrong, his heart was lifted up unto his own deſtruction, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.1. <hi>there is a woe for Ariel,</hi> the City where <hi>David</hi> dwelt, which Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> renders, the Altar of God, becauſe the Sacrifices and Ordinances of God were there; but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, (and ſo in the Margent it is rendred,) the Lyon of God, <hi>quia tanquam Leo Gentes alienas ſubjugaſſet:</hi>—None could ſtand before them;—There is a wo for them, becauſe they had in the greatneſs of their ſtrength and power, and victories, forſaken the Lord; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord ſaith he would bring diſtreſſes upon them,

                  <p>Thirdly, Former duties, nor former mercies ſhall not ſerve men, but if they do forſake the Lord, they ſhall be forſaken of him: firſt former duties will not ſecure men: here is a gracious Prince that had laboured ten yeers in the Reformation of Religion, and that with great ſucceſs, and had met with great oppoſition, and yet with reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion gone through all, yet the Lord tells them, that for all this, if after this they <hi>did forſake the Lord, he would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake them.</hi> There was in the days of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> the moſt glorious Reformation of Religion, that ever we read of in <hi>Iudah,</hi> he was <hi>ſuch a King as like unto him was none before him, nor after him ſhould ariſe the like:</hi> the people entring into a ſolemn Covenant before God, that they would be the Lords people; and the Reformation went farther, for it was the taking away of the High places alſo, which other Reformers left ſtanding: and they kept the Paſsover unto the Lord, <hi>ſuch a one as had not been ſince the time of the Iudges,</hi> and yet 2 King. 23.26,27. <hi>not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Lord turned not from the fierceneſs of his wrath.</hi> Here is a ſad and unexpected cloſe of this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous ſtory, and that not onely for old ſins; but <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1. the Land continued in the ſame evils ſtill, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lords controverſie continued againſt them: there were <hi>the remnants of Baal</hi> in the hearts of the people ſtill, and there were <hi>thoſe that did ſwear by God, &amp; by Malchom,</hi> that did endeavor ſo to keep up a mixture in Religion; and thoſe that were Apoſtates, and <hi>were turn'd back from the Lord,</hi> and <hi>men that were ſetled upon

                  <p>2 Former mercies will not ſecure you, if you forſake the Lord. Its true that former mercies are of a great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement unto us to keep cloſe to God: the cords of love lay upon men the ſtrongeſt bonds; but yet if they do not oblige us, they are not binding unto God. Its true, that faith may make uſe of former mercies, as an argument to a repenting and returning people, as <hi>Num.</hi> 14.19. <hi>Pardon the iniquity of this people according un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the greatneſs of thy mercy, as thou haſt forgiven this people from Egypt even until now,</hi> but it is no prevailing Argument for a back-ſliding people; but the Lord wil ſay, <hi>how long ſhall I bear this evil Congregation?</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>the word is gone out of his mouth,</hi> and judgement ſhall the ſooner and with the greater fury plead the cauſe of abuſed mercy in former deliverances, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.63. <hi>It ſhall come to paſs that as the Lord hath rejoyced over you to do you good, ſo alſo the Lord will rejoyce over you to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy you and to bring you to naught;</hi> the word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

If you be not bound by the <hi>cords of his law;</hi> let me tell you, he himſelf will never look upon himſelf as bound by <hi>the cords of his law:</hi> if they be no ingagement upon you, they will be found none upon him in the end. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 120.4. it is by ſome underſtood of the ſlanders of men; but it is by others underſtood of the judgements of God; <hi>there ſhall be mighty and ſharp Arrows, with coals of juniper,</hi> that is ſuch as burn with greateſt fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,

In thoſe things wherein the ſons of men are, and their luſts acted and more drawn forth, in thoſe the Lord doth delight that their judgement ſhould be. The people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were formerly weary of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, as we now are of Ordinances, and they did ſay to them, propheſie not, and cauſe the holy one of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ceaſe from us; therefore the Lord ſaith, he will cauſe the Sun to go down upon the Prophets, and he makes the day to be dark about them, that there ſhould be none that ſhould underſtand or be able to tell them how long: and when they deſired Teachers according to their luſt, and did ſay, Speak to us ſmooth things, and propheſie deceit; theſe rough-ſpirited men we cannot

                  <p>Sixthly, In the ſame degree that a people do forſake the Lord, will the Lord alſo forſake them: and ſo much the Hebrew word alſo doth ſeem to import <hi>in exiſtendo vos cum eo,</hi> in your being with him, he will alſo be with you, and in your forſaking of him, he will alſo forſake you. The Lord departs from a people <hi>gradatim</hi> by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral removes, to ſee if there be any <hi>that will ſtir up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to take hold of God.</hi> As <hi>the glory of the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the Temple,</hi> Ezek. 10.11. <hi>firſt he goes up from the Cherubins unto the threſhold, and from thence to the middle of the City, and from the City unto the Mountain:</hi> and theſe removes of God from us are anſwerable unto the degrees of our departing from him: for in theſe things the Lord doth exactly obſerve a proportion. As it is in the matter of outward afflictions, ſo it ſhall be alſo in ſpiritual deſertions: <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7.16. as pride doth bud, ſo the rod doth bloſſom; violence doth riſe up unto a rod of wickedneſs: their rod is taken out of their own ſins: their own wickedneſs doth correct them: and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the growth of ſin in them, ſo doth the rod grow for them, that it may be corrected. And ſo it is in deſertion alſo; with the upright the Lord will ſhew himſelf upright: if mens hearts be wholly with him, he will be perfect and intire with them: but if men be for God onely in ſhew, he will be for them and with them onely in ſhew: if they give unto him onely outward o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, he will give unto them onely a temporal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: if they do offer unto God but external ſervice,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:115739:149"/> and that which is ſeemingly ſervice, but really a ſin; he will beſtow upon them outward bleſſings, that is, that which ſhall be ſeemingly a bleſſing, but really a curſe: a bleſſing in the thing, but a curſe to the man. For the Lord will hold a proportion: as we forſake him, ſo he will in the ſame meaſure and degree, forſake us alſo. All the children of deſtruction, are not born at once, <note place="margin">Hoſ. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>the firſt is Iezreel, and the laſt Loammi;</hi> yea and Gods own people anſwerable unto their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from God, ſo they ſhall find the Lords with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawment from them; <hi>David</hi> had <hi>his firſt ways,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Chr. 17</note> and the people of God have <hi>their firſt,</hi> Rev. 2.4. and they that do decline from God in holy obedience, they ſhall finde the Lord will depart from them in reference to a gracious preſence: it ſhall not be with them as it hath been in times paſt: they ſhall remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber with bitterneſs after their departure from their former husband, that it was better with them then it is now.</p>
                  <p>2. Let us now look upon the grounds of this Doctrine, that upon our forſaking of God he will forſake us; and they are different, according unto a double ſtate of men in this life: ſome are in a ſtate of Nature; and ſome are in a ſtate of grace.</p>
                  <p>Firſt they that are in a ſtate of nature for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking God, ſhall be <hi>utterly</hi> forſaken by him, and that for ever; for the Lord doth deal with men according to the tenor of the Covenant, under which he ſtands; in all his adminiſtrations, he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways mindful of his Covenant. Now all men in a
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:115739:150"/> ſtate of Nature, are under a Covenant of works; for though this Covenant were broken in the fall, yet it was not aboliſhed, but ſtands in force ſtill unto all unregenerate men, to the end of the world; its true, that being become weak through the fleſh, it can give life no more, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Neither is that Arminian Doctrine to be received, <hi>Lex prima ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat primo foedere rupto per inobedientiam primi homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis;</hi> that men being conſtituted under the Curſe, the firſt Covenant being broken, all the debt of legal obedience which the creatures did owe unto God, did immediately ceaſe; for then, there ſhould have been no ſin after the firſt ſin; for if the Law ceaſed, there could be no tranſgreſſion: neither is it any way an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable unto Reaſon or Scripture, that becauſe man had loſt his ability to obey, therefore God ſhould loſe his authority to command. Now in the firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant God dealt with man by way of retaliation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.7. if thou doſt well, ſhalt thou not be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? the beſt ſervices muſt needs be rejected for the leaſt fayling; therefore in the creatures departing from God, he will alſo depart from him: and by the terms of the Covenant he is bound, if they forſake
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:115739:150"/> him, he muſt alſo forſake them: his Juſtice and truth do bind him unto it: and according to that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, it is, <hi>bonum ex integro conſtat; malum ex quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libet defectu.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2 There are ſome men in a ſtate of Grace, and the change of their eſtate depends upon the change of their Covenant: ſuch a mans ſtate is as is his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant under which he ſtands. He that is in a ſtate of Grace, is therefore tranſlated into the Covenant of Grace; and then all the dealings of God with him are anſwerable unto the tenor of the ſame Covenant: and this Covenant is <hi>an everlaſting Covenant,</hi> for <hi>he will write the law in their hearts, and put his fear ſo into them, that they ſhall not depart from him,</hi> Jer. 32.20. and therefore he will never forſake them ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly: for he hath ſaid, <hi>he will never turn away from them to do them good.</hi> We are far from that Doctrine as to conclude from hence, that the interchange of members between Chriſt and Satan, is frequent and ordinary; and that as Chriſt takes members from Satan, ſo doth Satan alſo take members from Chriſt; that a man may be a member of Chriſt to day, and a child of the devil to morrow; now in a ſtate of Grace, and by &amp; by in a ſtate of ſin; beloved of God to day, &amp; forſaken of God to morrow; for we read, <hi>that whom he loved once he loved unto the end;</hi> for he loves them not with a temporal, but with an everlaſting love: and as in reference unto a mans eternal conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there is a gulf fixed, which notes <note place="margin">Calv.</note>

We complain of the prophaneneſs of the people throughout the Nation; they are ſuch Principles as theſe that are the great Grounds of prophaneneſs: and from hence it goes forth into all the Land; for how ready will all they that were weary of
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:115739:155"/> Ordinances, and lookt upon them as a burden long agoe, how greedily will they imbrace ſuch a Doctrine as this is; that may be a bribe unto their Conſciences in their prophaneneſs, and utter neglect of God; ſurely it is a good rule, <hi>qui non eſt Religioſus, Chriſtianus non eſt:</hi> that man doth very much forfeit his Chriſtianity, that doth either in Doctrine or Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice in this manner decry the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Worſhip of Chriſt: I am not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſpeak much of <hi>Officers</hi> now, which is an Inſtitution, as well as that <hi>of Ordinances; for the Lord hath ſet them in the Church,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.28. and he hath appointed their term of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, <hi>till we all come unto the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Faith, unto a perfect man; till the whole body of Chriſt be gathered, and perfected; and the end,</hi> Epheſ. 12.14. why he hath appoynted them is, <hi>that we may not be carryed away with every wind of Doctrine;</hi> that
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:115739:155"/> was the end why God appoynted them, and this is the main reaſon why men oppoſe them; becauſe they cannot carry men away as they would, by this means; and thereſore it is a true ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, that never any man did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to overthrow and corrupt Religion, but he began with the Miniſtery firſt. It is that which <hi>Adam Contzen.</hi> directs to the Miniſters and thoſe that give their Teſtimony to the Truths of God, ſpecially ſuppreſs them, <hi>&amp; error cui patrocinium deerit, ſine pugna concidet:</hi> ſo calls he Truth; and there is a promiſe made to them, <hi>that God will be preſent with them to the end of the world;</hi> and a proviſion is made for them to the end of the world; for the Lord hath ordered, <hi>that they that ſerve of the Altar ſhould live at the Altar;</hi> Cor. 1.9,14. though now a great part of the Religion of the times is to cry down a Miniſtery, and ſo as <hi>Luther</hi> hath obſerved, Satan hath had two ways to put out the light of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:115739:156"/> 
                     <hi>mendaciis, &amp; Inopia:</hi> And he ſaith men do profeſs, <hi>Miniſtris nihil opus eſt:</hi> they were things not much to be regarded, though there is a juſtice to be exerciſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them as men, how much ſoever they are deſpiſed as Miniſters: but it were not much to be regarded, though you look upon them as men of all others the leaſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, if God were not forſaken in it; but to forſake Gods Worſhip, is in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures account to forſake God.</p>
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:115739:156"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, we forſake God by carnal confidence. The Lord ſaies, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.13. <hi>they have forſaken me, and they have digged to themſelves broken Ciſterns.</hi> Jer. 17.5. <hi>Curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is he that truſts in man, and makes fleſh his arm, and his heart departeth from the Lord:</hi> if the Lord be not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted alone in the ſoul, either <hi>ſub ratione boni, aut auxilii,</hi> the heart of man forſakes him, and leans on ſomething elſe that is not God. Now if it be Counſels of men, the power of Armies, the Aſſiſtances of Confederates, ſo far a man forſakes the Lord: therefore the Lord doth way lay all humane ſuccours, that they ſhall prove vain and unſucceſsful; and men ſhall be aſhamed of their Confederacies: <hi>thou ſhalt be aſhamed of</hi> Aſſyria, <hi>as thou haſt been aſhamed of</hi> Egypt <hi>thy conſidence;</hi> yea deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on comes out of it; they that ſit down under the ſhadow of a creature, it is but under the <hi>ſhelter of a bramble: fire will ſurely come out of it to conſume the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>dars of Lebanen;</hi> when men turn to God, they are taken off from carnal confidence, they ſhall then ſay, <hi>Aſhur ſhall not ſave us:</hi> therefore men turn to the creature when they do for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake and depart from God.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, men forſake God in their converſation: when they neither <hi>walk with God,</hi> or <hi>worthy of God:</hi> the waies of ſin are departing from God: <hi>going into a far Countrey, it is communion with Belial:</hi> and walking in waies of pride, oppreſſion and uncleanneſs, it is <hi>living without God</hi> and therefore ſurely it is a forſaking of him, a departing from him; and forſaking of his Truth and Worſhip; is the only and ſpecial means thereunto; our Saviour ſays <hi>John</hi> 17. <hi>Sanctifie them by thy Truth,</hi> &amp;c. Take away Truth, and ye deſtroy Holineſs at the root: Let men pretend holineſs whileſt they will, unclean opinions will ever be accompanied with unclean pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes;
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:115739:157"/> and therefore it is a vain thing for men to hope that a holy converſation can be maintained without truth, which is the inſtrument which the Lord uſeth of mens ſanctification, <hi>Job</hi> 6.14. <hi>he forſakes God, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakes the fear of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, What is it for a people to be forſaken of God? Firſt, when God withdraws the influence of his Spirit from the Ordinances, that though the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances continue, yet the influences are gone; it is the firſt ſtep of the Lords removing from a people, and this is properly the <hi>removing or departing of his glory from off the Temple;</hi> though the Lord is everywhere preſent, yet there was a gracious preſence there; <hi>Deus ubique eſt, ſed non eadem ubique praeſtat.</hi> And therefore there is a <hi>darkneſs that fills the houſe, when the glory of the Lord was departed;</hi> its true, that the Temple, and the Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces did continue, but it was but barely an outſide, for the preſence of God in glory and mercy was not among them; and therefore when the Lord returns to a people in mercy, the glory of the Lord doth in this manner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto their Ordinances, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43.4. <hi>while he may be found, ſeek the Lord;</hi> the time of the Spirits working in the means, <hi>is the day of ſalvation, Heb.</hi> 6. unto that people; there is a ground that drinks in the rain, not only of Ordinances, but of Influences: and the Lord will ſay, <hi>My Spirit ſhall not alwaies ſtrive;</hi> there is an oath that may go forth againſt a people, and then they are undone for ever: for <hi>the Lord is not as a man, that he ſhould repent:</hi> and this is the greateſt Judgement that can befall a perſon or a people in this life: for if the Spirit of the Lord depart from them, and evil Spirit from God in Judgement comes upon them: a Spirit of gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs, a vertiginous Spirit, which doth cauſe them to
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:115739:157"/> err in all the works of their hands: there is by ſome a great talk of converſion, that abundance have been lately converted: it is true, if turning unto a new opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, or being brought off from ſuch a party be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, there are abundance of ſuch turnings in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but ſuch a general converſion, that if we look into the converſation of men, yea even of them that do profeſs Religion and <hi>the power of godlineſs,</hi> and the <hi>good old way</hi> of holineſs in the practiſe of it, is even whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forgotten amongſt us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he takes away the Ordinances alſo: the preſence of God is in them: he is by theſe ſaid to <hi>dwell amongſt us:</hi> now when God departs from a people, he is ſaid to take away the Ordinances, which are the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible tokens of his preſence, <hi>Ier.</hi> 23.33. they ſay, <hi>the burden of the Lord:</hi> and they were weary of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God amongſt them, ſaies God, <hi>this ſhall be your burden, I will forſake you: Nulla poſthac erit Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetia,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Calvin.</note> 
                     <hi>Calvin.</hi> But what if it be ſo? its that in a ſpecial manner that we deſire: but conſider, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.20. <hi>I will caſt this houſe which I have ſanctified for my name out of my ſight, and I will pluck you up by the roots out of my Land which I have given you:</hi> when God once forſakes his Ordinances, he will the Land too.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Lord doth forſake a people, by taking away the former aſſiſtances that they have had, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying of them to his people: therefore the promiſe is <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62.4. <hi>thou ſhalt be no more termed forſaken:</hi> whilſt they were under the power of the enemy, and given up into the hands of their oppreſſors, ſo long they were a people forſaken of the Lord, <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 1.5. <hi>I will not leave thee, nor forſake thee:</hi> when God forſakes them, they ſhall not have the wonted preſence of God amongſt
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:115739:158"/> them: the Lord will neither bleſs their counſels, nor go forth with their Armies: but he will delight to make that people vile, that all their enemies ſhould take encouragement thereby, and ſay, <hi>God hath forſaken them:</hi> perſecute them, and take them, for <hi>there is none to deliver them;</hi> as the preſence of God is the great ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror unto all that are round about, <hi>he being a wall of ſire about them,</hi> and <hi>the glory in the middle of them;</hi> ſo the greateſt encouragement to the enemies, is, when they ſhall ſee that Gods people have not the wonted preſence or aſſiſtance of God with them: and they ſhall be a deriſion to all the Nations round about: ha, ha, ſo would we have it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, God doth forſake a people in reſpect of his returns of their prayers, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.1,2. <hi>My God, why haſt thou forſaken me? and why art thou ſo far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring? O my God, I cry in the day time, and thou heareſt not: and in the night ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon am not ſilent;</hi> and this is the true greatneſs and the glory of a people, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.7. that <hi>they have God nigh them in all that they call upon him for;</hi> and this hath been your glory in former times in the ſight of your adverſaries: that you could ſay, <note place="margin">Tertullian.</note> 
                     <hi>Caelum tundimus, &amp; miſericordiam extorquemus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the prayers of the people of God have been <hi>the fire that hath gone out of the mouthes</hi> of the people of God <hi>that hath conſumed your enemies</hi> on every ſide: as <hi>Rev.</hi> 11 5. We did no ſooner make our prayers, but we might as it were, with <hi>Stephen, lift up our eyes to heaven, and ſee Ieſus ſtanding at the right hand of God: tanquam cauſae ſuae Judex &amp; vindex:</hi> But if God forſake a people, they may <hi>cry, but the Lord will not hear them; he will ſhut out their prayers in diſpleaſure, and will cover himſelf
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:115739:158"/> with a cloud, that they ſhall not paſs through:</hi> when God takes away the ſpirit of prayer from his people, there is not a greater Argument that I know, that God doth intend to forſake them, and to <hi>ſhut out their prayers.</hi>

And which of you in authority that have abundance of outward beings, in compariſon of many of your Brethren, can abate any thing of what you can exact for any place or employment that you have, becauſe of the cry that is amongſt us, as <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi>
                     <pb n="262" facs="tcp:115739:159"/> did? <hi>Nehem.</hi> 5.15. where is <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> ſpirit? <hi>Former governours were chargeable to the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, beſides forty ſhekles of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but ſo did not I, becauſe of the fear of God:</hi> what abatement is there of mens ſallaries and payes? they that have abundance otherwiſe, that formerly never had, and could ſcarce ever have hoped for ſo much as now they have, and yet they cannot for the neceſſity of their brethren abate any of it; and how ſtrangely car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally confident are we? and ready <hi>to ſacrifice to our own nets,</hi> and to ſay, <hi>Our own hand hath wrought theſe delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances for us:</hi> and we think we have an Army, and a Navy, that is able to defend againſt all our enemies; but let me tell you, if you live upon theſe, though they <hi>be as the breath of your noſtrils, yet it ſhall be as fire to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume you,</hi> &amp;c. Iſa. 33.11. Now as for the truths of God and his Ordinances, how are they forſaken? all the world do witneſs againſt us at this day: and though much hath been preſſed that way unto a ſettlement, yet nothing is done: there are ſome <hi>that are enemies unto this building:</hi> all eſtabliſhment in the things of God avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and induſtriouſly its obſerved by ſome (I hope it will not prove a Propheſie) that in this Age only, the deſtructive work hath proſpered in the hand of thoſe that ſit at the ſtern: but for the deſtructive work, let it be undertaken by whom it will, yet it hath never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpered in any hand: therefore its feared, that Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in this thing is only to deſtroy, and that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the glory of the building unto the generations to come: But it will be objected, is there not power enough in Religion to avenge it ſelf? <hi>Religio contenta eſt viribus ſuis; nec ſpoliata eſt vi ſua, etiamſi nullum habeat vindicem.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.6. our weapons are in a readineſs
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:115739:159"/> to avenge all diſobedience; and it will be ſaid, have not we made Laws againſt them? Laws againſt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, Laws againſt Blaſphemy? but what are dead Laws to living examples? we are exhorted <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. <hi>not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them into our houſes, and not to bid them God ſpeed,</hi> &amp;c. Yet you know <hi>they bring not this Doctrine:</hi> and yet who are the men of your counſels? who are admitted to your houſes? received at your tables as your chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt friends but ſuch men? and thoſe that you know to be ſuch men, that oppoſe and are profeſſed enemies to the truths of God, in ſuch things that you your ſelves know to be truths: And will that maxime of <hi>Mariana</hi> bear you out? <hi>Princeps nil ſtatuat de Religione:</hi> its true, Conſcience will ſeek a bribe, if the mind be upon any thing, it will colour it over with fair pretences: but it is but a <hi>fig-leafe,</hi> and will appear ſo before God: ſurely you ſhould walk in the waies of Godly Magiſtrates who have gone before you. <hi>Now to which of the Saints will you turn?</hi> When did ever any good Magiſtrate plead, that in the things of God, as a Magiſtrate, he was not concerned?</p>
                  <p>But it will be ſaid; All this is but begging the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. For this ſuppoſes that the Magiſtrate is concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in matters of Religion, which is the thing in doubt: I look not on it as ſeaſonable to diſpute the thing now; only crave leave to offer a ſew conſiderations to you about it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that which may provoke God to forſake a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that certainly Magiſtrates are concerned in: But the things of Religion are the great things that provoke God to forſake a Nation, in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8.5. the Prophet ſaith, <hi>they have ſet up an Image of jealouſie to provoke me
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:115739:160"/> to depart from my ſanctuary:</hi> And the next news you hear is, <hi>God departs from the City.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, that which laies the foundation for the overthrow of Governors and Government, that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates are concerned in; but corruption in Religion doth ſo: take but the example of a heathen, in <hi>Ezr.</hi> 7.23. <hi>Whatſoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be diligently done for the houſe of the God of heaven; for why ſhould there be wrath upon the Realm of the King and his ſon?</hi> Nay conſider but one man, its a ſtrange inſtance that <hi>Lachiſh</hi> ſhould be called <hi>the Beginning of ſin,</hi> in <hi>Mich.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Why, Lachiſh the Kenite carryed away Michals Gods;</hi> they conquered <hi>Lachiſh,</hi> and ſet up the Idols there: this began in one man, and never ceaſed till it had deſtroyed the whole Nation, brought the Captivity at laſt.</p>
                  <p>Nay I ſhould deſire to add one thing more; the neglects in this kind hath brought the greateſt Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon the Church and people of God in the world: two or three inſtances I ſhall give: What brought the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> upon the Weſtern Empire? the neglect of the Arrian Hereſie. Becauſe <hi>the woman was not relieved,</hi> the Lord brought in thoſe barbarous Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for her ſuccour: What brought in the <hi>Saracens</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Eaſtern part of the Empire? why corruption in Religion: <hi>they worſhipped Images, and they repented not;</hi> What brought in Antichriſt, <hi>the temple of God becoming an outer Court?</hi> there was a general neglect of the things of God: and by this means Antichriſt aroſe: And <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, this year <note place="margin">Auſtin.</note> 
                     <hi>Libertatem perditionis promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit. Iulian</hi> did ſuffer all men to uſe their own Religion with freedom: leaving every one freely to deſtroy
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:115739:160"/> themſelves: Let theſe things be conſidered, and I doubt not but it will appear that Magiſtrates are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what concerned in the things of God: if you were preſt to any thing that did not ſavour of truth, or were any way unſutable to the Goſpel, happily ſomewhat might be ſaid: But that which hath been preſt upon you, is only this: Give teſtimony for thoſe truths that you your ſelves profeſs, and diſcountenance the contrary errors: And I am ſure they that are moſt tender in theſe things and ſpeak leaſt in it, ſay, <hi>Igne charitatis haeretici ſunt comburendi,</hi> we muſt burn the heretick with the fire of Charity: Love the man, but hate the error: but not to countenance the error by countenancing the man.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould now preſs you to conſider the miſery that will come upon you by Gods forſaking us. I will only now ſpeak briefly to three things concerning it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, if God forſake us, all the creatures will forſake us: as when God became an enemy at firſt to mankind, all the creatures alſo did become their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: it were no matter for the deſertion of all the neighbouring Nations, though <hi>we were as a ſpeckled Bird unto them</hi> and they all hate us: yet, <hi>if God be with us, who can be againſt us?</hi> but, <hi>Tolle Deum &amp; nullus ero;</hi> if the <hi>glory of the Lord departed,</hi> then <hi>the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims lifted up their wings, and are gone:</hi> as the voice that was heard to ſay in the Temple the night before <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was taken, <hi>Migremus hinc,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly; if God forſake us, all the creatures will break in upon us: God hath forſaken him, purſue him and take him: for his hedge, his fence is taken away: <hi>I will take away the hedge thereof,</hi> ſhall the Lord ſay, and
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:115739:161"/> then a poor creature may comfort himſelf as <hi>Saul</hi> did in the creatures, <hi>honour me before the people,</hi> when <hi>the Lord had rejected him;</hi> but it is but cold comfort for a man ſo to do; for thy own ſervants will then become thy enemies.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, there is no one thing that afflicts and affects a gracious heart more then deſertions; either in Church or ſtate, or his own ſoul, he fears nothing elſe; all that <hi>David</hi> ſtill prayes for, is <hi>O Lord, forſake me not: Oh for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake me not utterly; Lord be not thou far from me:</hi> there is this difference commonly between a godly man and a wicked man: the one fears Gods puniſhments: but the other fears Gods departure: and therefore <hi>Auſtin,</hi> It is as with a chaſt wife and a harlot: <note place="margin">Auſtin.</note> they both fear their husbands; <hi>Haec ne veniat; illa ne decedat:</hi> And the reaſon is, becauſe the one ſeeks only bleſſings from God; and the other only ſeeks communion with God; and if he had never ſo much from God, yetif he be denyed to <hi>ſeek his face denyed fellowſhip with him,</hi> and if the Lord do ſo forſake him, all things are bitter unto him, becauſe the joy of his heart is gone; ſurely, if you go on <hi>to forſake the Lord, he will forſake you;</hi> but the deſertion begins on your part; <hi>if you do not forſake him, he will not forſake you;</hi> therefore ſo far as you have back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlided from God, return to him, and you have this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>I will heal your backſlidings.</hi>

Secondly, <hi>non omnino:</hi> it is not a blindneſs in all things, but in reſpect of this one particular, to ſee Jeſus Chriſt to be the Meſſiah, and the Saviour of the world, the conſolation of I ſrael which they expected and waited for; in this reſpect they were under a judicial blindneſs: they that were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, <hi>Ieſhuron, the ſeeing people,</hi> and they that had <hi>lived in the valley of Viſion,</hi> and knew more of the mind of God then all the Nations of the earth beſides, for <hi>in Iudah is God known and his name is great in Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c. ſo that there is a particular blindneſs in Judgement; that as God may and doth hide ſome objects from a people, as he did <hi>Lots</hi> door from the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> and ſo the Diſciples that conferr'd with Chriſt, <hi>their eyes were held that they might not know him;</hi> ſo the Lord doth in Judgement hide ſome Truths &amp; ſome Doctrines from men, that they ſhal not ſee them; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.15. to this day when <hi>Moſes is read, there is a vail upon their hearts,</hi> that is, in reference unto Chriſt, and the things of Chriſt, which are foretold and ſpoken of in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but when they ſhall turn to the Lord, <hi>the vail ſhall be taken away,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo, though they know much of the Law and the mind of God, in reſpect of moral

               <p>Secondly, this Converſion ſhall be in the height of their miſery, when there ſhal be the greateſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and affliction upon them, that ever was ſince their diſperſion; <hi>There ſhall be a time of trouble, ſuch as there never was ſince they were a Nation unto the ſame time; and at that time, Daniels people ſhall be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as many as are found written in the book,</hi> Dan. 12.1. when they ſhall <hi>be dry bones, and all hope ſhall be paſt with them,</hi> that they ſhall ſay, <hi>our bones are dry bones, our hope is paſt, and we are cut off for our part; then the dry bones ſhall live, and they that ſleep in the duſt ſhall awake,</hi> Ezek. 37.11.12. <hi>Behold, Oh my people, I will open your graves, and cauſe you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Iſrael.</hi> That's the Lords time of love above all other times, when men lie wallowing in their blood; when their hopes ſhall be loweſt, their Redemption ſhall be near.</p>

But now they ſhall chuſe him as their glory, and they ſhall rejoyce and glory in him, and they ſhall in their return <hi>ſeek the Lord and David their King,</hi> Hoſ. 3.5. that is, they ſhall ſeek God aright, according to the way of the Goſpel, and with Goſpel apprehenſions, they ſhall not onely ſeek the Lord from whom they have grievouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted; but they ſhall ſeek him in Chriſt, and they ſhal come to him in the way that he hath appointed; that is, in Chriſt, and unto Chriſt ſhall they come.</p>

But is not this ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of their return from <hi>Babylon?</hi> How can it? did they come out of Captivity weeping? It cannot be meant fully of that return, though there are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent degrees of the accompliſhment of propheſies; but if we look to verſe 1. <hi>At the ſame time, ſaith the Lord, I wil be the God of all the Tribes of Iſrael; and they ſhal be my people;</hi> Which can hardly be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto the ten Tribes, in that return to be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; for they did never return from the land of their Captivity unto this day.

But if ſo it ſhall be ſorrow under ſuffering in the one, and under the ſight and apprehenſion of their ſin in the other.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, the Scripture ſeems to ſpeak, as if the great meanes of their Converſion, ſhould not be by the preaching of the Goſpel, as the Gentile Churches are brought home unto the Lord, but that it ſhall be <hi>by ſight, and by a viſible appearance of the Lord Jeſus unto them.</hi> I ſhall aſſert nothing poſſitively in it, onely give me leave to ſet before you ſome Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:115739:167"/> that ſeem fully to ſpeak ſo much, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. <hi>They ſhall look upon him whom they have pierced, and mourn.</hi> And that it is not barely a ſpiritual looking upon him with an eye of faith, ſuch as the holy Ghoſt calls, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.40. <hi>Seeing the Son, and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving on him,</hi> but that it is a bodily viſion, and to ſee him with bodily eyes; for <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.13. there is the <hi>Son of man comming in the clouds of heaven brought to the ancient of days, to receive a Kingdome.</hi> What Kingdom; ſure his Davidical Kingdom, when he <hi>ſhall ſit on the throne of his Father David.</hi> When Chriſt receives this Kingdom, it is not as he receives the ſpiritual Kingdom, and entred upon the adminiſtration of the providential Kingdom that was <hi>by his ſitting down at the right hand of his Father,</hi> and ſo enter as man actually, upon the adminiſtration of all things: for its plain, that to receive this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which ſhall be after the four beaſts are deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>He ſhall come in the Clouds of Heaven, and they ſhall bring him unto the ancient of dayes:</hi> he comes atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the Angels, and they <hi>bring him unto the ancient of days;</hi> its true, that <hi>Gods comming in the Clouds, his riding upon the Clouds;</hi> its that which notes out the eminent, viſible, glorious appearance, of his Majeſty: but its the appearance here of Chriſt, as he is the <hi>Son of man,</hi> which I conceive is never found to be ſo uſed in the Scripture, but at the laſt day, the <hi>Lord Jeſus ſhall appear in the clouds when he comes to judgement.</hi> As ſpoken of a viſible appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; ſo this alſo ſhall be, and ſo much haply is meant, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.30.31. <hi>Then ſhall appear the ſigh of the Son of man in Heaven, and then ſhall ye ſee the Son of man comming in the clouds of Heaven:</hi> I know its a perplexing Scripture, yet haply is meant this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:115739:167"/> of the Son of man, not to judgement, but as a ſigne that the judgement is neer: that which they may be as truly aſſured of, as the husband-man can be, that the <hi>ſummer is neer, when he ſees the fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree put forth leaves, &amp;c.</hi> and therefore I ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conceive there is meant the appearance of Chriſt in the clouds for the converſion of the Iewes, and to receive a Kingdom, rather then his appearance at the day of judgement, when he muſt ſhortly give up the Kingdom; and I am induced rather to think ſo, becauſe it follows, <hi>and he will ſend the Angels with a great ſound of a Trumpet, and they ſhall gather together the elect from the four windes.</hi> Which is, I do not conceive to be reſtreined unto the day of judgement, though the Apoſtle doth ſo ſpeak alſo <hi>of the general Reſurrection,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.52. <hi>The Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet ſhall ſound, and the dead ſhall be raiſed, the Lord ſhall deſcend from Heaven with a ſhout, with the voice of the Archangel, and the trumpet of God,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4.16. But when this Trumpet ſhall ſound, all the Nations ſhall be raiſed, bad as well as good, Elect as well as Reprobate, and they ſhall all awake unto judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but this is a Trumpet, that <hi>gathers onely the Elect from the four winds:</hi> therefore it ſeemes that none ſhall hear this trumpet but the <hi>Elect;</hi> and that it ſhall ſound unto them as ſuch, and ſhall never reach unto the Reprobate, and that inſtruments of mercy or judgement are called <hi>Angels</hi> is ordinary, and that what the Lord doth eminently, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly and dreadfully make known his glory to them, with the ſound of a Trumpet, is clear, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.10. &amp; 4.1. and therefore it may be ſpoken of the Lords gathering in the Elect of the Iewes, <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not caſt off whom he knew before,</hi> who are now
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:115739:168"/> ſcattered, even into the four windes of Heaven: and therefore there is that which ſeems to incline unto this, of the converſion of the Iewes at firſt, ſhall be by ſight and by appearance of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt viſibly in the clouds of Heaven, and ſo <hi>Pauls</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion ſhould be as the firſt fruits, the Lord ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth him as a pattern to the whole Nation; his converſion was by a ſight of Chriſt from Heaven: <hi>and a glorious light that ſhone round about him:</hi> and ſo its probable there ſhall alſo be, but yet not all of them ſo converted, but the Lord will take ſome of them, and make them to be as Prieſts unto the Lord, and they ſhall declare his glory amongſt the Gentiles, and ſhall be inſtrumental in gathering of them, and they ſhall alſo bring in their brethren, (that is) ſay ſome, the unconverted Gentiles, which ſhall be as brethren, then all the differences between them, being taken away. Others more properly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it unto the Iewes, the remainder of them not brought in the firſt grand converſion of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for it is ſaid, <hi>They ſhall bring all their brethren for an offering unto the Lord out of all Nations, upon Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Charriots, and upon wild beaſts unto my holy mountain;</hi> So that it may be ſome of them ſhall be converted by the appearance of Chriſt, and others of them by the preaching of the Goſpel, by thoſe that are amongſt them converted: that their brethren going forth to them, and declaring to them the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning of God in wayes of grace unto their Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the great things that he hath done for them, and ſo they having a <hi>ſpirit of grace poured out upon them,</hi> ſhall alſo be brought as an offering to the Lord.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, The manner of their calling ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:115739:168"/> eminent and glorious, unto the admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all Nations, that they ſhall all ſee how the Lord hath honoured them, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 60.1. <hi>The glory of the Lord is riſen upon them,</hi> Hoſ. 1.11. <hi>Great ſhall be the day of Jiſreel,</hi> it ſhall be a glorious day, that which ſhall make them honorable in the eyes of all the Nations of the Earth: that <hi>ten men out of every Nation under Heaven ſhall lay hold of the ſcirt of a Jew, and ſhall ſay, we will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.</hi> Pſ. 10.2.16. <hi>When the Lord ſhall build up Sion, he will appear in Glory;</hi> they ſhall have glorious appearances of him, ſuch as no people ever had, and this ſhall make <hi>them to be the deſire of all people,</hi> as they have had a great day of miſery, ſo a great and glorious day of their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance ſhall come, to the aſtoniſhment and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Nations: and there are many great reaſons that it muſt be a great day; but I cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon them.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, the time of their calling ſhall be when <hi>the fulneſs of the Gentiles is come in, blindneſs ſo long is happened unto them:</hi> when the four Monarchs are caſt down to duſt in the period of them, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.12.13.14. after the deſtruction of Antichriſt, when <hi>the little horn is ſlain, and his body given unto the burning flame;</hi> now <hi>he comes to receive a Kingdom of the ancient of days;</hi> and it ſhall be when <hi>the ſeventh Angels Trumpet ſhall ſound,</hi> then <hi>the Kingdoms and Nations under the whole Earth, become the Kingdoms of the Lord and his Chriſt,</hi> Rev. 11.16. which is from the ſetting up, <hi>the abomination of deſolation, the</hi> 1290. <hi>days,</hi> which ſhal be the year of the Iews redemption, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.11. which is to be finiſhed four thouſand year after which is 1335. daies, but theſe are times <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>David my ſervant he ſhall feed them, and rule over them: I will be their God, and David my ſervant as a Prince amongſt them: when the dry bones are riſen, David my ſervant ſhall be their Prince for ever, remove the Diadem, &amp;c, he will overturn, overturn, overturne, and then will he come whoſe right it is. The Scepter ſhal depart from Judah, and they ſhall be many days without a King:</hi> Any form of government of their own, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 34. and what then? <hi>they ſhall ſeek the Lord, and David their King. unto whom the Father hath committed all judgement, Joh.</hi> 5.22. and in a ſpecial manner the Kingdoms and Nations over this people, that <hi>from his preſence their judgement is to go forth,</hi> and therefore he ſhall in a more ſpecial manner be <hi>be King of the Jews,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own people, unto whom he hath a right of inheritance, more then he has over any people of the world beſides, and yet I do confeſſe, I do not ſee light from the Scripture to aſſert the perſonal reign of Chriſt upon Earth over them, and the Saints reigning with him in his perſon; I know <hi>Aliud eſt Chriſtu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> regnare in Sanctis; Aliud Sanctos regnare cum Chriſto:</hi> both ſhall be in this life in ſome ſenſe; but yet whether Chriſt ſhall rule them by a perſonal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence upon earth, is unto me ſtill a doubt; but this I ſay, the Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath a peculiar right
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:115739:170"/> unto the Kingdom of the Jews, as he is of the ſeed of <hi>David: And God will give him the Throne of his father</hi> David.</p>
               <p>Twelfthly, The people ſhall be exceeding ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this Church, walking in truth and ſincerity; there is a <hi>form of Godlineſs,</hi> but there is little of the <hi>power</hi> now, there ſhall be much of the power of Godlineſſe, of the life of Chriſt manifeſted in them; <hi>thy people ſhall be all righteous, the branch of my planting that I may be glorified,</hi> Eſay 60.21. <hi>It is the Bride, the Lambs wife having the glory of the Lord upon her,</hi> Rev. 21.10,11. its true there ſhall not be perfect holineſſe in the Saints, for <hi>there is a Tree of life for medicine as well as for meat,</hi> Rev. 22.2. and they ſhall not be without Hypocrites, thoſe that ſhall cleave unto them by flattery, but yet there ſhall be a glorious ſpirit of diſcerning even of them alſo, <hi>and they ſhall be without,</hi> not onely <hi>that make,</hi> but <hi>they that do love a lie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirteenthly, This Church ſhall have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of converts, and their Ordinances ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding fruitfull, to bring in ſouls into the Lord, Ezek. 37.9,10,11. <hi>Where the Waters come, every thing ſhall live, and there ſhall be a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of fiſh, even as that of the great Sea ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding many, thy Gates ſhall be open continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not ſhut day nor night,</hi> that they may bring the riches <hi>of the Gentiles and their Kings ſhall be brought, and they ſhall flie as a Cloud, and as Doves unto their Windows,</hi> becauſe of the glorious Majeſty of the Lord that is ſeen amongſt them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Fourteenthly, They ſhall be brought home in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their own land, and they ſhall dwell there, they ſhall dwell in their own Citie as in the days of

               <p>Fifteenthly, There ſhall be a perfect union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ten Tribes, and the two Tribes, and the hatred ſhall depart, that breach was never yet made up, But then <hi>the ſticks ſhall become one,</hi> Ezek. 37.19. <hi>The envy of Judah ſhall depart, and</hi> Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im <hi>ſhall vex</hi> Judah <hi>no more: I wil gather them out of all Countries, whither I have driven them in my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and I wil give them one heart, and one way, and then</hi> Jehovah <hi>ſhall be one, and his name one, &amp;c.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Sixteenthly, They ſhall be the great inſtrument in the hand of the Lord, for to ruine and deſtroy the Turkiſh Empire, when the Lord ſhall bend <hi>Judah</hi> for him, and fill his bow with <hi>Ephraim,</hi> Dan. 11.40.44. We read of <hi>the King of the South, whom tidings out of the North, and out of the Eaſt ſhall trouble.</hi> There are ſeveral reaſons, why by the King of the South, I conceive to be meant the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh Empire, as that which had the next power, and exerciſed the next Tyranny over the Jews; and being come to a height, there is tidings from the Eaſt and North, troubling the gathering together of the Jews, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.7. when the bones came together, there was a great noiſe, and a ſhaking, and ſtanding up, they became an exceeding great and formidable Army; and he ſaith, that theſe bones are the houſe of Iſrael returning into their own land; here is the tidings that trouble the King of the South; there the Turk invadeth the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous holy Mountain, and then he comes to an end,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:115739:171"/> and none ſhall help him: it is <hi>Euphrates muſt be dried up to prepare the way for the Kings of the Eaſt,</hi> Rev. 16.12. that they may join themſelves with the Weſtern Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Seventeenthly, At their returning to the Lord, there ſhall be by them a wonderfull bleſſing upon all the Gentile Churches, their gain ſhall be much by it, they were gainers by the Jews rejection, their caſting off was the inriching of the World, their diminiſhing the riches of the Gentiles, <hi>how much more their fulneſſe,</hi> Rom. 11.12.15. it ſhall be as life from the dead, it is not I conceive ſpoken of the Jews, that there comming in ſhould be ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and by an act of almighty power as a reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as it is reſembled, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. but it ſhall be unto the Gentiles, as life from the dead; that is, as miſery is expreſt by death, ſo all joy and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is expreſt by life, it ſhall be as it were a reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, put a new face upon the world, that as it ſhall be a glorious condition upon earth, when all the Saints ſhall ariſe and ſtand upon the earth with joy, being perfected in their graces, and in their faculties, ſo ſhall this be even unto the Gentiles, as well as unto the Jews, a reſurrection.</p>
               <p>Eighteenthly, With the calling of the Jews, the Kingdome of the God of heaven ſhall be ſet up; that which is now ſo commonly called the fifth Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, ſhall begin when the four Monarchies are deſtroyed, which ſhal be with the drying up the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Euphrates,</hi> that is, the Turkiſh Empire: Its true that Chriſt hath a Kingdome, during the rule of the Monarchies, in the dayes of thoſe Kings God doth ſet up a Kingdome, but it is a little ſtone and it breaks the Image by degrees, and then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:115739:172"/> becomes a Mountain, and the Kingdome given unto the Saints of the moſt high: Which in the Book of <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.27. its meant the Jews. who are every where called the holy people, not of the Gentile Saints, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.24. and 12.7. and therfore it is they muſt take the Kingdome and poſſeſſe it, and it ſhall be given to them, which is not wel applied by all that will call themſelves Saints and holy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as if they were to take to themſelves the rule of all the Kingdomes of the world.</p>
               <p>Nineteenthly, Unto this time the perfect ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of all the propheſie of God doth belong: there are degrees of fulfilling the prophecies more or leſſe in all times; but its unto this that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the World are reſerved, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.7. its never before the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Trumpet ſound, that the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of God is finiſhed; that is, all thoſe ſecrets that were in the boſome of God to perform, and which he revealed unto his ſervants the Prophets, all thoſe do not receive their full accompliſhment; all that God doth intend to do for his people in the advancement of his ſon in this World, is now ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled and accompliſhed.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, And this glorious condition ſhall continue unto this people unto the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that they ſhall ſuffer no more, the Sun ſhall no more go down, nor the Moon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw it ſelf: <hi>Eſay</hi> 60.20. I will ſet my Tabernacle in the middle of them for evermore, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.26. <hi>by an everlaſting covenant, and I will plant them in their own land with my whole heart, and my whole ſoul:</hi> and <hi>I will never turn away from them to do them good; there ſhall be no more ſorrow, nor crying, all tears from their eyes ſhal be wiped away, and no more curſe as they
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:115739:172"/> formerly had,</hi> Rev. 22.4. <hi>they ſhal be caſt out of the land no more,</hi> &amp;c. There Sun did riſe and ſet, but now ſhal go down no more: Theſe things require fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcuſſing then one hour permits: But having laid down theſe things in the general, I hope it will ingage others to look further into them.</p>

                     <p>But <hi>Jehu</hi> took no heed to walk in the way of the Lord God of Iſrael with his heart: for he departed not from the ſins of <hi>Ieroboam</hi> which made Iſrael to ſin.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the Text are three things principally contained. Firſt, a great ſervice perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Iehu,</hi> both againſt the houſe of <hi>Ahab.</hi> and the houſe of <hi>Baal,</hi> with the Lords commendation of the ſame, ver. 30. <hi>that he had done well in executing that which was right
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:115739:175"/> in his eyes, and had done according to all that was in his heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, a great reward promiſed by God in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of this ſervice; not <hi>ex precio operis,</hi> but <hi>ex lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitate donantis; thy children to the fourth Generation ſhall ſit upon the throne of Iſrael:</hi> whoever is a labourer in Gods Vine-yard, ſhall not go away without his penny, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. God will ſay, <hi>Call the labourers and give them their hire:</hi> yea to ſhew that he loves righteouſneſs, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy ſervices of unſanctified men ſhall not go unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded; only, indeed, as their heart is not perfect with God in the ſervice, ſo neither is his perfect with them in his reward: (<hi>for with the perfect only he will ſhew himſelf perfect, Pſa.</hi> 18.) but the reward ſhall hold proportion to the ſervice: the ſervice unſanctified, ſeemingly a ſervice, but really a ſin: ſo the reward ſhall be in it ſelf a bleſſing, but unto them a curſe: the ſervice temporal only: <hi>ſo ſhall the reward be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, the perſon cenſured by the Lord: though God approve, and reward that which is good; yet he doth not juſtifie that which is evil: neither can his love to the one, blind his eyes towards the other: <hi>his eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, and his eye-lids try the children of men.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though he had done this great ſervice, yet in all that he had done, the Lord ſaith to him, <hi>he did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, but not with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect heart:</hi> he took no heed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Grace is <hi>the Law written in the heart, Jer.</hi> 3.33. <hi>the Table fleſhly,</hi> the heart: the Miniſters the pen, the Spirit the Ink, and Chriſt the Scribe, which is the Apoſtles Metaphor, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.2,3. the word is a mould, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

Now in the Law, the mould, there are two things: Precepts enjoyning duty: and Prohibitions forbidding ſin: now <hi>Jehu</hi> had not the Law written in his heart, and therefore his heart was not right with God in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, for the Precept, his heart was not right; for he took no heed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, for the Prohibition, his heart was not right: <hi>for he departed not from the ſins of,</hi> &amp;c. The firſt part of the cenſure is upon the unſoundneſs of <hi>Jehu,</hi> in reſpect of the Precept: <hi>but</hi> Jehu <hi>took no heed:</hi> and therein are four things ſetting forth his unſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>Firſt, his inadvertency and inconſideracy, <hi>he took no heed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, his partiality, <hi>he took no heed to walk in the Law of the Lord: integritas objecti.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, his inconſtancy ſome ſteps he did ſet in this way, but it was not his <hi>walk.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, his inſincerity; he took no heed to walk <hi>with his whole heart;</hi> Many duties that his conſcience was convinced of, he neglected; there was his partiality: The duties which he did were perfunctorily performed, therein he was heedleſs; in the beſt duties that he did, he had ſelf-ends, his whole heart was not in them, there was his inſincerity: and the duties that he did ſet up, he did take them up and lay them down as might ſtand with his own worldly and by reſpects: he did not walk in them, therein is his inconſtancy: and in them all his hypocriſie.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, if we conſider his holineſs, therefore the Angels are ſaid to be <hi>full of eyes round about,</hi> (that is) as it were made up of nothing but heedfulneſs and watchfulneſs in all the ſervices that they perform unto the Lord: and what makes them ſo to be? it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they behold God in his holineſs and purity, <hi>Iſa</hi> 6 21.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, as a Judge, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.48. <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.15. and that for this cauſe <hi>he puts no conſidence in his Saints, he charges his Angels with folly, Job</hi> 4.18. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 2.13.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, if we conſider his ſpecial Preſence; it is true, that becauſe he is everywhere preſent, therefore a man ſhould <hi>walk before him and be upright, Gen.</hi> 17.1. but, when we come do to him ſervice, he hath promiſed a more ſpecial preſence: <hi>he walks in the middle of the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Candleſticks, Rev.</hi> 2.1. <hi>in the Temple,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>the glory of the Lord was there, Ezek.</hi> 8.3,4. <hi>there he will meet, and there he will bleſs, Exod,</hi> 20.24. and to note his ſpecial preſence, it is ſaid, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6 16. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                  <p>Fifthly, if you conſider the jealouſie of God, which is the argument uſed by that good man <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> 24.19. <hi>you cannot ſerve the Lord, for he is a jealous God:</hi> his ſcope is not to deterr them from ſervice, for he exhorts them thereunto, as we ſee <hi>ver.</hi> 15. but he ſaith, ye cannot ſerve the Lord; to ſhew the difficulty, how hard it is to ſerve him acceptably, that they might do it with the more fear, care, and heedfulneſs: and the ground of it is, for <hi>he is a jealous God;</hi> Now jealouſie is exceeding obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant and quick-ſighted, takes notice of the leaſt neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects, not only from a Corrival, but alſo from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon on whom God hath ſet his love; ſoon takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the leaſt ſlight and neglect, and having once ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of it, we know that it doth make deep im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon the heart; for <hi>jealouſie is cruel as the grave, and is as the rage of a man; Pro.</hi> 6.34 <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.6.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, yet to preſs it further, Conſider the rule of this ſervice; for as a Chriſtians ſervice muſt be ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, ſo it muſt be regular, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6 10. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

<pb n="298" facs="tcp:115739:179"/> hath a rule without, according to which every ſtroke muſt be regulated, therefore unto that he muſt take heed: ſpecially, if we conſider in this rule theſe four particulars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it is a ſtraight rule; there is no turning, no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: for <hi>the Law is holy,</hi> Rom 7.12. <hi>perfect,</hi> Pſa. 19.7. it omits no duty, it bears with no ſin, it is <hi>a ſtraight gate, a narrow way, Mat.</hi> 7.13,14. there is no rule that ever man made, but it hath ſtill been too ſhort, and there hath been ſomething in particular not determined by that rule: its not ſo here, neither in the actions, words, or thoughts of the heart: therefore <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>I have ſeen a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap> end of all perfection:</hi> look upon the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and exact Laws of men, and there be defects in them; a man may be able to look to the end of them, and ſee where they do fail; <hi>but thy commandment is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding broad;</hi> it reaches to all perſons, places, times, actions and thoughts; he could ſee no end thereof wherein it was defective, it had ſuch a latitude, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.96. and the more ſtraight the rule is, the more we ought to take heed leaſt we ſtrike aſide to the right or leſt hand: therefore in reſpect of this rule, if in any thing, that counſel of <hi>Solomon</hi> is to be taken, <hi>let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eye lids look ſtraight before thee, Prov</hi> 4.25.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is alſo a ſpiritual rule, <hi>the Law is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, Rom.</hi> 7.12. directs not only the motions of the body, but alſo of the Spirit; <hi>it is the candle of the Lord:</hi> the Spirit enlightned by this rule, <hi>ſearching the inward parts of the belly, Prov.</hi> 20.27. opening the treaſures of darkneſs, <hi>diſcovering</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                     </gap>, <hi>the hidden things of darkneſs, and the counſels of the Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding between the ſoul and the Spirit, the joynts and the
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:115739:179"/> marrow, and is a diſcerner of the ſecret purpoſes and intents of the heart, Heb.</hi> 4.12. Now the ſoul of man being the act of the body, is far more active then the body, and the thoughts and motions of it are infinitely more in number, and more ſuddenly and unobſervedly break forth then thoſe of the body; therefore he that will keep cloſe unto the rule, had need as the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts, <hi>give heed to it</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Conſider alſo the univerſality, and reality of the Law; the Holy-Ghoſt calls it therefore <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.8. that which is in all things the higheſt Judge: from whence, though <hi>quatenus habet rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem foederis,</hi> there is, yet <hi>quatenus habet rationem regulae,</hi> there is no appeal; from the Law in the point of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and curſe there is: but in point of obedience there is no appeal: So that there is now but one Law, one God, and one Judge, and one Hell, to the higheſt as well as to the loweſt: and there is no appeal from it; this <hi>Law binds Kings in chains, and Nobles in fetters</hi> as well as the meaneſt, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 149.8. Now had not a man need to give heed to ſuch a Law, from whence there is no appeal, but if a man be caſt, to the ſame Law he muſt ſtill ſtand?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Conſider further the harmony and cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of this rule; they are like <hi>Ezekils</hi> wheeles, they do one involve and include another, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.10. <hi>he that breaks one, is gu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>y of all:</hi> the whole Law, and the ſame authority is wronged; and the ſame diſpoſition of heart manifeſted in one, that would be in the breach of them all: and would ſurely ſhew it ſelf if there were occaſion, and opportunity to draw it out: and it is the want of this right knowledge of the rule, that makes men ſet light by many ſins, and count them ſmall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:115739:180"/> they look not upon the Law broken in reſpect of its harmony, and dependence, and ſo ſee not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves guilty of all but that man that ſees the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt tranſgreſſion in the leaſt, and ſees the whole Law broken in every deviation, will ſay that he had need take heed that he tranſgreſs not in one, leaſt he make himſelf guilty of all.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, yet to preſs it farther, Conſider the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who thou art, that doſt perform the ſervice, and if thou be but well-acquainted with thy ſelf, thou ſhalt ſee great reaſon to be exceeding heedful when thou comeſt before the Lord, and that in theſe particulars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Conſider, by ſin <hi>we are become unprofitable, Rom.</hi> 3.12. droſs and chaff, fit for nothing; and unto this add our enmity unto God; we are naturally <hi>ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in our minds, through evil works, Col.</hi> 1.21. and this takes off a mans heart: that as by ſin he is made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, ſo he hath no mind to do God ſervice: for he is an enemy in his mind: now what a mans mind is not on, unleſs he give diligent heed, he will quickly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh in his own thoughts, and tender to God but his labour and bodily exerciſe, and no more.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in all our ſervices unto God we are full of ignorance: <hi>we know not how to pray, or what to ask, Rom.</hi> 8.26 therefore Chriſt offers daily <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.7. <hi>for the ignorance of the people</hi> in the ſervices that they do perform. Now the leſs acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance a man hath with any thing, the more heed he had need to take; elſe immediately he is like to miſcarry: for ignorance is the mother of error: no man wonders to ſee the blind go out of the way.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, there is in all our ſervices much forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in reſpect of the things we do know: <hi>ye have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:115739:180"/> the exhortation,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.5. <hi>I thought good to put you in remembrance: though you have known &amp; been eſtabliſhed in the preſent truth,</hi> as 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. therefore a man had need recollect his thoughts, and take in the whole rule, that ſo he may not afterward ſay, <hi>it was an overſight;</hi> and his conſcience condemn him in his own account.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, even in thoſe things that we do remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and actually Conſider, yet there is much dulneſs, and deadneſs, and unmoveableneſs in the affections to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them: <hi>ye are dull of hearing, Heb.</hi> 5.11. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a man had need take the more heed to ſtir up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and to awaken theſe, as <hi>Deborah</hi> doth, <hi>Awake, awake, Iudg.</hi> 5.12. and as <hi>David, Awake my glory awake lute and harp,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 57.8. therefore a man had need to whet and ſharpen the rule upon himſelf as well as upon others. See <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.7. the word ſignifies to whet, ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, to repeate often, and with intention.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, there is much raſhneſs and inconſideracy in all things that a man puts his hand unto; ſpecially in the ſervice of God: and therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> well ſaw it to be an evil, and our nature was prone to evil; for he would never have given that preventing Phyſick, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5.2. <hi>be not raſh with thy mouth.</hi> Whereas he ſaith, <hi>the heart of of the Righteous teacheth his mouth, Prov.</hi> 16.2,3. he ſpeaks that ſpecially, becauſe Gods word in his heart he hath well digeſted: there is in the beſt men much precipitancy, many overſights, much inadvertency: <hi>there is folly and madneſs in the heart of a man whileſt he liveth; Eccl.</hi> 9.3. and both are haſty: therefore a man had need take heed to himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, there is much looſneſs and vanity in a mans thoughts, <hi>Ier.</hi> 4.14. <hi>how long ſhall thy vain empty
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:115739:181"/> thoughts,</hi> that have nothing in them, <hi>lodge within thee!</hi> that when a man ſets about any duty, his thoughts will not keep to the thing in hand, <hi>he likes not to retain God in his knowledge, Rom.</hi> 1.28. the mind of man will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver leave toſſing from one thing to another, till it ſhift out thoughts of God, and of the ſpiritual part of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: alſo mans mind in a duty converſing with God, is like one that looks through an Optick-glaſs upon a ſtar, with a palſey hand: it is long before he can ken and diſcern it, and as ſoon as he hath found it, ſo unſteady is his hand that he looſeth it again; and ſuch is the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteadineſs of our thoughts</hi> in the moſt ſerious ſervices. Now ſeeing it is ſo, if ever a man will ſerve God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably, he had need ſerve him heedfully: <hi>take heed how you hear, watch unto prayer,</hi> Mar. 13.33.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, here is alſo a ſin reproved, and that is heedleſneſs; but <hi>Iehu</hi> took no heed, or <hi>did not diligently obſerve to walk,</hi> &amp;c. hence,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Heedleſneſs in a mans converſe with God, is a provoking evil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, It is ſo by the Lords own ſentence and cenſure, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.13. <hi>This people draw nigh to me with their lips, but their hearts are removed far from me. Ezek.</hi> 33.31.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is ſo by the Saints own confeſſion, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.67. <hi>Our righteouſneſſes are as filthy rags; there is none to call upon thy name, and that ſtirs up himſelf to take hold of thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is ſo by Gods juſt Judgement, as in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.7. where <hi>Uzzah</hi> without due conſideration did touch the Ark, not being thereunto called, it is ſaid, <hi>the Lord ſmote him for his errour,</hi> or as the word, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>for his raſhneſs and forgetfulneſs, and he dyed before the
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:115739:181"/> Lord,</hi> Now to preſs this upon you alſo, I deſire that theſe particulars may be well conſidered.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, ordinarily, according to your care and heed in the duty, ſo will God meaſure to you grace, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by the duty, <hi>Mar.</hi> 4.24. <hi>Look with what meaſure you meet, ſhall be meaſured to you again:</hi> that is, look what meaſure of care and preparation you bring to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, ſuch a meaſure of fruit and profit ſhall you carry from it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when either Judgement ſhall come, or God thus open thy conſcience in ſickneſs or death, all theſe ſervices that thou haſt heedleſly performed, thy ſpirit in them will fade away as leaves nipped with the wind, and a man ſhall have no comfort in them at all, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.6. <hi>we fade away as a leafe in our iniquity:</hi> that is, the iniquity of our righteouſneſs, <hi>the iniquity of our holy things:</hi> whereas the duties of godly men that have life, and care, and ſubſtance in them, <hi>their leaves ſhall not fade, and their fruit ſhall not be conſumed, Ezek.</hi> 47.12.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Conſider the oftner a man doth perform duties in a heedleſs manner, the worſe he will daily grow; and what good ſoever he had in him before, will ſurely decay, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.18. <hi>Take heed how you hear; for to him that hath ſhall be given; and from him that hath not, ſhall be taken away;</hi> he that <hi>ſtirs not up the meaſure of grace</hi> that he hath in the duty, he will ſurely grow worſe after his performance: for in the Scripture ſenſe, <hi>idem eſt non habere &amp; non uti.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, there is no ſervice that thou performeſt heedleſsly but thou art in danger of ſome temporal Judgement; we ſee <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> were conſumed with fire from heaven, <hi>Lev.</hi> 16.2. And <hi>Uzzah</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi>
                     <pb n="304" facs="tcp:115739:182"/> 6.7. and who can promiſe himſelf ſecurity from the ſame puniſhment that doth go on in the ſame ſin?</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, hereby thou ſinneſt againſt a cloud of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, the bleſſed example of all the Saints: and it is in ſome reſpect a greater Aggravation of ſin, to ſin againſt Example then againſt Precept, becauſe the one hath a ſtronger hand upon a man then the other; <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepta ducunt, exempla trahunt;</hi> look to <hi>Abraham the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the faithful,</hi> ſee how heedfully he walks with God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.27,30. <hi>Seeing I have taken upon me to ſpeak to the Lord that am but duſt and aſhes:</hi> and then by and by, <hi>Oh let not my Lord be angry, and I will ſpeak,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iacob</hi> is humbled that he was not ſo aware of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, as he ought to have been, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.16. and <hi>David</hi> was afraid when the Lord had made a breach upon them, and cryes, <hi>Oh ſhall the Ark of the Lord come to me!</hi> and durſt not remove the Ark till he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of the mind of the Lord, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.8,9.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, it is a ſin againſt great mercy; thou ſhouldeſt be <hi>a veſſel of honour fitted for the maſters uſe;</hi> and in this reſpect godly men prize their ſervices above their comforts; And amongſt the glorious promiſes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10 17. Conſider this, <hi>he prepares the heart to pray, and cauſeth his ear to hear:</hi> he will accept the heedful ſervice, and will give much grace: <hi>to them that hear ſhall more be given, Mark.</hi> 4.24. elſe <hi>Mar.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Curſed be that deceiver that hath in his flock a male, and offers to the Lord a corrupt thing,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this is not only an evil thing, but an evil ſign alſo: and ſo here made by the Holy-Ghoſt a ſign of hypocriſie and unſoundneſs of the heart of <hi>Iehu:</hi> hence this Doctrine.</p>
                  <pb n="305" facs="tcp:115739:182"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A conſtant heedleſneſs in a mans converſe with God, is a dangerous ſign of an unſound heart, Iſa.</hi> 29.13. <hi>they draw neer to me with their lips;</hi> but even while they did ſo, they took no care to bring their hearts with them, but they were removed from the Lord: and this heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs performance was a ſign of their hollowneſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoundneſs: So Chriſt ſaith of the Phariſees, their care was wholly about the out-ſide of the duty, <hi>making clean the out-ſide of the cup:</hi> Chriſt made this a ſign of their hypocriſie; for hypocriſie is but an out-ſide: like cloth of <hi>Arras,</hi> fair and beautiful without, but look to the inſide, nothing but raggs and ends: now when a mans conſtant care is only for the outward per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, and never looks whether the heart anſwer within, that is an unſound heart: but yet I ſay, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant heedleſneſs; for the beſt of Gods people are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times too raſh, and haſtie, and inconſiderate in their approaches unto the Lord but it is not conſtantly ſo: neither do they reſt therein: but that man with whom it is ſo, ſurely he hath nothing but a form, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5.</p>
                  <p>Now to apply this briefly, there are in it three Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Be humbled for the hypocriſie paſt: ſo doth the Church, <hi>Iſa</hi> 6.4,6. <hi>they were aſhamed of their righteouſneſs:</hi> Hypocriſie is ſo exceeding hateful to God, that he makes all their puniſhments to be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured out by that; <hi>they ſhall have their portion with Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, Mat.</hi> 24.51. they ſhall have <hi>their portion with the Devil, and his Angels:</hi> to ſhew none ſo neer to the Devil as they: no man ſo hateful unto God or crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures but the Devil: and this is a moſt common and ordinary way of hypocriſie that can be: this makes the
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:115739:183"/> Saints groan in themſelves, therefore <hi>Bradford</hi> did write in his Letters to his friends, <hi>Iohn Bradford,</hi> a very hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, a very painted hypocrite: look back with how little preparation, how vain thy thoughts, how thy eyes have wandered, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Apply the righteouſneſs of Chriſt for the pardon of this amongſt other evils, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.38. <hi>Chriſt muſt have upon his forehead holineſs to the Lord, that he may bear the iniquity of your holy things;</hi> a great part of the holineſs of Chriſt is appointed for this, for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of your unholineſs in ſervice.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, be more heedful for the time to come; and to ſtir you up to it, conſider but only this, how heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful you have been in the waies of ſin, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.30 <hi>He ſhuts his eyes that deviſeth miſchief;</hi> a man that will ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and be intent upon a thing, will ſhut his eyes, that ſo objects from without do not diſtract his mind, ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent is this man in a way of deceiving, <hi>Iob</hi> 17.11. the thoughts of man are called the <hi>poſſeſsions of the heart,</hi> whereupon a mans heart doth dwell; now we know up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any ſinful projects and thoughts of evil, a mans thoughts are ſo ſettled upon them, that a man cannot remove them, but there they dwell; but as for the things of God, a mans heart dwells in them as one doth that is in another mans houſe, he is alwaies going and taking his leave.</p>
                  <p>Now let this heed be ſeen, Firſt, in thy Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>prepare with all thy might,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> did for the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Temple, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.2. and ſay in thy heart, as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> did, <hi>the houſe muſt be great and magnificent, for it is for the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.6. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 12.3. Come to the Ordinances as <hi>wells of ſalvation, as breaſts of conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Iſa.</hi> 66.11. to ſee the face of Chriſt, and the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:115739:183"/> of the Lord: Come to them as <hi>the miniſtration of the ſpirit and a Doal of ſpiritual gifts, Rom.</hi> 1.12.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when thou art come, take heed in the performance, <hi>be not raſh with thy mouth, let not thy heart be haſty,</hi> Eccl. 5.1,2. when thou doſt, <hi>do it with all thy might,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> did, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.17. act all graces, ſtir up all thy affections, <hi>awake my glory,</hi> &amp;c. elſe when thou haſt done, there will be an out-ſide of ſervice, but yet they will not be <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. They will be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty works, hollow, no inward grace, or ſtrength, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to fill them out.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, to ſhew that thou canſt never take heed enough, after every ſervice go and humble thy ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God for thy want of heed and watchfulneſs; ſay with <hi>Abraham, I that was duſt and aſhes did take upon me to ſpeak to the Lord:</hi> and with <hi>Iacob, How dreadful is this place, it is the houſe of God, the gate of Heaven:</hi> God was here, and I was not aware, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, and to enable thee ſo to do, get the fear of the Majeſty of God throughly planted in thy heart, and whenever thou comeſt before God, ſtir up thy fear, and all thoſe awful conſiderations that may be; for fear is the watch-man of the ſoul, exceeding heedful and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant that is appointed as the remedy; <hi>be not raſh with thy mouth, but fear thou God. Eccl.</hi> 5.7. and to this end, <hi>walk in the fear of the Lord all the day long:</hi> walk with God in his fear at other times: a ſpecial cauſe why men are no more heedful in Gods worſhip is, becauſe they give liberty to themſelves, and have no eye to his preſence at other times, therefore, <hi>be thou in it all the day long.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But wherever the Lord ſends this Goſpel and the Ordinances thereof, he doth ſend it with a threefold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</p>
               <p>Firſt as <hi>donum, with reference</hi> to our thankfulneſs.</p>

               <p>The words are the <hi>Exprobation</hi> of <hi>Caparnaum,</hi> and the ſentence which the Lord Chriſt did denounce thereupon, becauſe they had neither anſwered the Lords mercy nor expectation. Firſt, he looked for fruit, and there was nothing but leaves; <hi>he looked for grapes, and they brought forth wild grapes:</hi> he looked for repentance, and behold impenitency; <hi>no man repented of his wickedneſs, ſaying, what have I done, but they held faſt deceit and refuſed to return, Ier.</hi> 8.5,6. Therefore <hi>he</hi> that <hi>upbraids none propter inopiam &amp; neceſsitatem, Iam.</hi> 1.5. before they do receive mercy, yet he doth upbraid them <hi>propter ingratitudinem,</hi> after they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: he upbraids none <hi>reſpectu Dei dantis,</hi> as if he

                  <p>If you ask me wherein doth this advancement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt that a people have by <hi>Ordinances?</hi> I anſwer, it doth conſiſt in theſe ſix particulars, all of them matters of great honour to a people.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it is a great honour to any people for the Lord to avouch them publikely to be his people; this is the
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:115739:188"/> honour of the S<hi rend="sup">ts</hi> at the laſt day; when the Lord breaks up the Houſe keeping of this great world, he will leave the lumber of it, take it who will, but the Lord will himſelf own his <hi>Iewels,</hi> and he will take them and avouch them for his own before the world, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.17. and this is the advancement of a people by the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; <hi>I entred into Covenant with thee, and thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cameſt mine, Ezek.</hi> 16.8. upon this ground the Lord is pleaſed to ſpeak of them as a people that he did ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally own: and of them as a people that had ſpecial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in him; therefore he is pleaſed to ſtile himſelf <hi>the God of Iſrael, the Rock of Iſrael, the hope of Iſrael,</hi> and all by reaſon of the Covenant that he had made with them, and the Ordinances that he had ſtabliſhed amongſt them: But when once by ſin the Ordinances are either corrupted, or removed, the Lord owns that people no longer; <hi>Call them Loammi, for they are not my people, I will not be their God, Hoſ.</hi> 1.9. In a common calamity it is ſaid, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4 1. <hi>that ſeven women ſhall lay hold upon one man, and ſay, we will eat our own bread, and wear our own clothes, only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach:</hi> if it were a reproach amongſt men not to be called by the name of a Husband, what is it when the Lord ſhall as it were give a people a bill of divorce and ſay, call them <hi>Loammi,</hi> they are not my people, I will be ſtiled their God no more.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is a great honour and advancement un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a people to have God preſent with them, and as it were to reſide amongſt them; this was the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Jews, <hi>What Nation is there ſo great who have God ſo nigh them, as the Lord our God is in all that we call upon him for? Deut.</hi> 4.7. there the Lord doth promiſe his preſence, and his divine bleſſing: <hi>In the place where I
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:115739:188"/> record my name, I will come unto you, and there I will bleſs you, Exod.</hi> 20.34. And the Lord did never manifeſt his preſence ſo gloriouſly as he hath done in the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Goſpel, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Therein we behold as in a glaſs the glory of the Lord.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. What is this glaſs but the ſpiritual adminiſtration of the Goſpel, and the Ordinances thereof, the vail of carnal ſtupidity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken from the heart, and we know <hi>Quod videtur in ſpeculo imago non eſt;</hi> they are the reverberated ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the thing it ſelf, and therefore ſeeing in a glaſs is the cleareſt way of viſion, next to face to face: yet thus God vouchſafes his preſence to a people in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel Ordinances. And in theſe we have the preſence of Chriſt alſo; <hi>he walks in the middle of the Golden Candleſticks, Rev.</hi> 2. whenſoever you ſeek him, be ſure <hi>he is gone down to the Gardens of the beds of ſpices, to feed in the Gardens, and to gather Lillies, Cant.</hi> 6.2. inſomuch that the Goſpel and the Goſpel Ordinances thereof are called <hi>the face of Chriſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 4 6. that is, that which doth as lively repreſent his preſence unto us, as if he were preſent with us in the fleſh: ſo that when a man ſhall come to behold him in glory, and to ſee him as he is, he ſhall be able truly to ſay, this is the face that long ſince hath in the Goſpel been exhibited unto my faith. What ſhall be the advancement of all the Chriſtians in glory? it ſhall be only the beatifical Viſion, when they awake to be ſatisfied with his likeneſs, to ſee him as he is; now if this be begun here in the Ordinances, that may be well counted the advancement of a people; that is unto them as it were the beginning of eternal glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, fruitfulneſs alſo is unto a people great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement; and on the contrary, barrenneſs is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:115739:189"/> 
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 30.23. <hi>The Lord hath taken away my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach;</hi> but they were never ſo much honoured by the fruit of their bodies, though in that God made good his promiſe to encreaſe them as <hi>the ſtars of heaven, and as the ſand upon the Sea ſhore,</hi> yet I ſay they were never ſo much honoured by the fruit of their bodies, as they were by the fruitfulneſs of their Ordinances: They are therefore called <hi>the Bed</hi> wherein Chriſt doth em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace his Church, and wherein ſouls are begotten to the Lord, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Our bed is green; glorious things are ſpoken of Zion the City of God:</hi> what be they? I will make mention of <hi>Rahab, Babylon, Philiſtin, Tyre</hi> with <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> it ſhall be ſaid this and that man was born in her, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that is, though they were ſtrangers unto <hi>Zion</hi> in their firſt <hi>birth,</hi> and ſo children of other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; but yet for their ſecond birth, their new birth, they ſhall know it to be in <hi>Zion,</hi> by means of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and ſhe ſhall be called the mother of them all: and this is made the glory of a Church <hi>under the</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; <hi>the dew of thy birth is of the womb of the morning, Pſal.</hi> 110.3. that is, multitudes ſhall be born unto it as the drops of the dew that are <hi>begotten in the womb of the morning.</hi> But when the Ordinances are either corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted, or removed, Chriſt meets his Spouſe in this bed no more; when the ſon of righteouſnes with-holds his beams, this dew is not exhaled and a man ſhall not find a drop falling from the womb of the morning; this is a great reproach unto a people: <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Thy teeth are like a flock of ſheep coming up from the waſhing; they bear twins, and not one is barren amongſt them:</hi> by the teeth of the Church ſome underſtand the Miniſters, <hi>quos aliis erudiendis Chriſtus praefecit;</hi> for the office of the teeth is to chew and to prepare the meat that it
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:115739:189"/> may be fit nouriſhment for the reſt of the members, ſo do theſe. <hi>Brightman,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Brightman</note> 
                     <hi>Dividendo, diſtinguendo, nodos ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vendo, obſcura illuſtrando, dentium funguntur munere,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe for their purity are like a <hi>flock of ſheep newly waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and for their fruitfulneſs, <hi>they bear twins, and not one is barren amongſt them,</hi> but by their labours they bring forth much fruit, and they bring home many a ſoul to the Lord; but if once God withdraw his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, his people become barren: as it is in the Church of the Jews; and it is true of the ſeven <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches, and many other forſaken Churches of the Gentiles; <hi>the barren hath born ſeven, and ſhe that had many children is waxen feeble, Iſa.</hi> 5.4.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly its a glory to a people to have ſtore of all things in it, ſo that they may be able to communicate to others in their neceſſities, but need not borrow of any: this was the advancement that the Lord promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed unto his people, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.12. <hi>you ſhall lend unto other Nations and ſhall not borrow;</hi> this is that wherewith God hath exceedingly honoured this Nation of ours, and when that we many times vainly boaſt that we need not for outward things be beholding to any people; but much greater is this glory in things ſpiritual, and all this is by the Ordinances; if the embryos in the womb of the Church want nouriſhment, <hi>her Navil is like a round Goblet that wants not liquor:</hi> and by it the children in the womb are nouriſhed unto life, <hi>Cant</hi> 7.2 if babes want milk, they may ſuck and be ſatisfied with theſe <hi>breaſts of Conſolation, Iſa.</hi> 66.11. if the children want bread, <hi>the belly of the Church,</hi> the Sacrament of the Lords ſupper, the belly which receives the ſuſtenance for the reſt of the body, <hi>is like a heap of wheat ſet about with Lillies, Cant.</hi> 7.2. if ſtrong men want meat, it is to
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:115739:190"/> be had in them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12. and if they need water for their ſpiritual refreſhment, <hi>here are the wells of ſalvation, Iſa.</hi> 12.3. and that you may not think that in the daies of drowth theſe will be drye, the Lord tells you, that there are ſprings to feed them; <hi>all my ſprings are in thee, Pſal.</hi> 87. <hi>ult.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But when the Lord takes away the Ordinances, then the tongue of the ſucking child cleaves to the mouth for thirſt; then the children cry for bread, and there is none to break it to them; then they that fed delicately upon the pureſt Ordinances, they are deſolate in the ſtreets, and they that <hi>were brought up in ſcarlet imbrace dunghills;</hi> it is ſpoken by the Prophet of a bodily fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, <hi>Lam.</hi> 4.5,6. it is much more true of a ſpiritual famine, when <hi>men ſhall run from Sea to Sea to ſeek the word of the Lord, and ſhall not find it, Amos</hi> 8.12. this is not only a miſery, but alſo a diſhonour unto any people.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, its a great advancement when the Lord makes a people flouriſh in outward things, <hi>making them the head and not the tail,</hi> as the Lord promiſed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.13 and how comes it to paſs that a people do not flouriſh? all the outward proſperity that we have, in which we ſo much glory, it is only by the Ordinances, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.19,20. the Lord threatens that if they did forſake his Ordinances, and ſerve other Gods, then <hi>he would remove his Ordinances from them; and the Houſe that I have ſanctified for my name, I will caſt out of my ſight,</hi> &amp;c. And what follows? then ſaith the Lord, <hi>I will pluck them up by the roots out of the land that I have given them:</hi> when the Ordinances were removed, and the Lord called them <hi>Loammi,</hi> all their outward proſperity did quickly vaniſh, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.9. <hi>I will take away my corn in
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:115739:190"/> the time thereof, and my wine in the ſeaſon thereof, and I will recover my wool and my flax given to cover thy naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.39. <hi>I will break down thine eminent place:</hi> that is, the Temple, where they did play the Harlot, and ſet up the Image of jealouſie before the Lord, <hi>Cap.</hi> 8. therefore the Lord will remove the Ordinances; and what then? then they ſhall ſtrip thee of all thy cloathes, and leave thee naked and bare: we therefore that count our outward proſperity our glory, conſider we hold it by the Ordinances.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, its a great advancement to a people to be well fortified, ſo as to be able in danger, both for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and offence to ſecure themſelves, not to fear their enemies; this was the glory that God did vouchſafe the Jewiſh Nation, and was ſometime the glory of the Engliſh alſo, <hi>the fear of thee ſhall fall upon all Nations round about, Deut.</hi> 2.25. Theſe are ſpiritually the <hi>Towers of Zion, Pſa.</hi> 48.12,13. that we are bid to tell, and <hi>the bulwarks</hi> that we are wiſhed to <hi>mark:</hi> it is becauſe of this that the Church is deſcribed to be <hi>terrible as an Army with banners. Cant.</hi> 6.10. that is, becauſe the <hi>weapons of our warfare</hi> in them are not carnal, <hi>but mighty through God:</hi> therefore they are as great a dread unto the enemies, as an Army ſet in battle-array. But as they are either corrupted by a people, or removed from them, ſo doth their defence depart, as the Lord threatens, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.5. <hi>I will take away the hedge thereof, and it ſhall be eaten up; I will break down the wall thereof and it ſhall be trodden down.</hi> Now what was this hedge and this wall? nothing elſe, <note place="margin">Muſculus.</note> as <hi>Muſculus</hi> interprets it, but the Ordinances, the Word, and Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which did ſerve for two ends, as a hedge and a wall <hi>ad ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem &amp; ad munitionem:</hi> therefore when the Lord took
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:115739:191"/> away the Ordinances, their defence departed from them; and as men corrupt them, ſo they break the Hedge and pluck down the wall of our protection; it is true, it may not fal at once, but one picks out one thing, and another another, till at laſt they make a plain way for the Beaſts of the field to break in upon the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard of the Lord: In all theſe reſpects, and in many more, the Ordinances of the Goſpel in their purity and power are a great advancement to a people.</p>
                  <p>Surely then they are in an errour that eſteem the Ordinances in their power to be a matter of diſgrace, a note of indignity upon any place or perſon. Firſt, make it your glory. Secondly, walk toward it as your glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: for that which is ſo great an advancement to a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, muſt needs be an honour to a perſon alſo; yet ſuch is the enmity and the folly of our nature, that we are apt to glory in any thing (yea many times in thoſe things that are our ſhame) <hi>the wiſe man in his wiſdom, the ſtrong man in his ſtrength, and the rich man in his riches,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Jer.</hi> 9. and paſs by that as an aſperſion, which indeed would make us truly honourable, and in compariſon of others advance us up to heaven: for any thing elſe to be pointed at, men count an honour, <hi>pulchrum eſt digito monſtrari,</hi> &amp;c. there goes a rich man, a wiſe man, a great Schollar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but to be pointed at, there goes a holy man, a diligent hearer, a conſtant frequenter of the Ordinances <hi>in the place where Gods honour dwelleth:</hi> this is an imputation, and a matter of diſgrace: and this eſpecially in any of the higher and the greater ſort: <note place="margin">Salvian.</note> It is that which <hi>Salvian</hi> in his time did complain of, <hi>p.</hi> 113. that if any Noble man or great man begun to be religious, <hi>ſtatim honorem nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litatis amittit; quantus in Chriſtiano populo honor Chriſti,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:115739:191"/> ubireligio ignobilem facit.</hi> The ſame is the diſeaſe of the preſent times, that diſhonour ſome men for no cauſe but becauſe they do honour God, of whom the world may truly ſay, Thy God hath kept thee from ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
                  <p>It will appear in the conſideration of theſe things: Firſt, what a man counts a matter of honour, he will not be aſhamed to appear to be: <hi>Paul was not aſhamed</hi> to preach the Goſpel, <hi>but was abundant in it, laboured more then they all:</hi> why? becauſe he counted it the matter of his glory, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.20. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                     </gap> it was ſo his labour, that he counted it his honour too, and that made him ſo abundant in it, he was willing to appear ſo to be: the Martyrs in the Primitive times counted Chriſtianity their honour, and therefore they were not aſhamed to profeſs with triumph before their cruelleſt perſecutors, <hi>Chriſtiani ſumus,</hi> &amp;c. but amongſt us we find men are loth to be taken notice of for conſtant preachers, for diligent hearers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe they count it will be a blemiſh to their names, and may be a ſtop to their honour, and preferment in the world, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus many a man is by this means kept off from the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances which would be his glory, <hi>&amp; quodammodo mali eſſe coguntur, ne viles habeantur:</hi> they muſt be evil, or elſe they ſay they ſhall be vile: if they be not wicked, they ſay they ſhall be men of no eſteem: Surely, all thoſe that are aſhamed to appear, or to be thought holy, they count the Ordinances of God their diſgrace, and not their honour: for a good man is that <hi>Seneca, Epiſt.</hi> 81. <note place="margin">Seneca.</note> 
                     <hi>boni viri famam perdidit ne perdiret Conſtantinus:</hi> let every man look into his own heart whether it be ſo with him. I accuſe none, but as <hi>Salvian</hi> ſaith, <note place="margin">Salvian.</note> 
                     <hi>Si quis in ſe eſſe novit quae loquor non à mea ſihi haec lingua dici aeſtimet:
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:115739:192"/> ſed à conſcientia ſua:</hi> not my tongue, but his own heart is his accuſer.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, what a man counts his honour, that he will have recourſe to, or ſetch comfort or encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from it in diſgrace, or any other calamity what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. When <hi>Mordecay</hi> refuſed to bow to <hi>Haman,</hi> unto what did his heart recoyl in this contempt, as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived? <hi>Heſt.</hi> 5.10. <hi>it is ſaid, that he told his friends of his glory, riches, multitude of children, and all the things wherein the King had promoted him, and how he had advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him above the Princes,</hi> &amp;c. and with this he bore up his own Spirit. So it will be with the Ordinances; if a man make them his glory, as the Lord himſelf tells his people, <hi>Iſa</hi> 30.20. though they were not freed from outward afflictions, <hi>though they were fed with the bread of affliction, and the water of trouble, yet their Teachers ſhould be removed into corners no more, but their eyes ſhould ſee their Teachers,</hi> &amp;c. and with this the Lord ſtrives to uphold their hearts againſt all their outward calamities; they ſhould be ſure of plenty of the bread of life, though they did want the ſtaff of bread; when a ſoul is able to turn in upon himſelf, and in any calamity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his ſpirit herewith; It is true God feeds me with the bread of affliction, but yet my eyes do ſee my Teachers; and can he be hungry that is fed with <hi>the bread of life?</hi> can he fare meanly that is alwaies at a <hi>feaſt of fat things?</hi> No ſurely; brown bread and the Goſpel is rich proviſion. Can he thirſt that may at pleaſure <hi>draw water with joy out of the wells of ſalvation?</hi> Can he be poor unto whom is daily offered <hi>the unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able riches of Chriſt?</hi> Can he be ſick to whom <hi>the Sun of righteouſneſs doth ariſe with healing in his wings?</hi> and can he be alone, who is come <hi>to the innumerable company
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:115739:192"/> of Angels, or the general aſſembly and Church of the firſt born which are written in heaven, &amp; to God the Iudge of all?</hi> &amp;c. Thus we are by Goſpel-Ordinances, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22,23. <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.2. Chriſt ſaith unto the poor man ſick of the Palſey, <hi>Son, be of good chear, thy ſins are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given thee:</hi> A poor man in ſickneſs and in pain, how could he be of good chear? yea there is ſufficient in the Goſpel, and the Comforts and Ordinances thereof, to chear a mans heart, and to bear him up againſt all the outward ſorrows, and calamities in the world; if a man do make the Ordinances of the Goſpel the matter of his honour, then they will be his chiefeſt joy in the beſt times, and his only joy in the worſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, a mans honour, and that which he glories in, he will lay all at ſtake to defend; the people of Iſrael counted <hi>David</hi> a great honour to his Nation as indeed he was, and therefore they called him <hi>the light of Iſrael,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam</hi> 21.17. and being in battle, there came <hi>Iſhbebenob</hi> the Giant, and would have ſlain <hi>David;</hi> but <hi>Abiſhai</hi> the ſon of <hi>Zerviah</hi> interpoſed himſelf, reſcued the King, and ſlew the Philiſtine. Now when the Giants of the world ſtrike ſometimes at one Ordinance, ſometimes at another, and think ſurely to <hi>quench the light of Iſrael;</hi> Where is the man that hath interpoſed himſelf, and born the blow that he might ſuccour the Ordinances? Where is the man that is of Saint <hi>Bernards</hi> mind, <note place="margin">Bernard.</note> 
                     <hi>Malo in nos murmur hominum quam in Deum; bonum eſt mihi, ſi Deus dignetur me uti pro clypeo.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <label>Objection</label> But when you have ſaid all, the world will never count theſe Ordinances an honour, nor thoſe that do frequent them to be honourable men, but either men of mean parts, or mean fortunes, the inſtable multitude, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or what ever a man was before, he ſhall never be
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:115739:193"/> ſo eſteemed afterward, <hi>Si honoratior quiſpiam religio ni ſe applicuerit:</hi>

                     <label>Anſwer.</label> But conſider, Firſt, though the world will not ſo count it, yet there is an honour that comes from God only, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.44. and <hi>there is circumciſion in the heart, and in the Spirit, whoſe praiſe is not of men, but of God, Rom.</hi> 2. <hi>ult.</hi> There are indeed two great rate Books, or counts in which all the perſons and actions of men be valued; Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s book, and the worlds; and they ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on perſons and actions different rates, for that which is highly eſteemed amongſt men, is an abomination in the ſight of the Lord, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.15. and there is many a mans perſon and actions when they are weighed by the world, are conceived to be great weight, and yet when the Lord comes to weigh them, are found too light, and it is his Sentence muſt ſtand: he is praiſe-worthy, and that man is honourable, not whom himſelf, nor whom the world, but whom the Lord commends, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.18.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for the world, we know it is unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, and therefore unable to eſteem either the comforts or the honours of the Ordinances: for <hi>they are men of another Generation, Luk.</hi> 16.8. In eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a great deal of wiſdom and art is ſeen, and that cannot be expected in thoſe whom the Scripture doth every where brand for folly: every man may ſee a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtone, but he muſt be a Lapidary that knows how to value it; every man ſees the Sun but he muſt be an Aſtronomer that ſhall be able to meaſure it, and take the quantity thereof: they that know no honour but the <hi>praiſe of men,</hi> its no wonder if they be not able to judge of the praiſe of God, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.11. whatever the
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:115739:193"/> world counts of honour and deſcent, the Lord ſaith, they of <hi>Berea</hi>

                     </gap>, <hi>they were better deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed then the reſt of Theſſalonica, in that they received the word with readineſs of mind, and ſearched the Scriptures daily,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, though they ſhould count it a diſgrace, yet look upon the Ordinances alwaies as thy honour, and value not the Judgement of ſuch men; ſay, <hi>its a ſmall thing to me to be judged of you or of mans day:</hi> let it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that you as much undervalue their Judgement, as they do your waies; this was <hi>Luthers</hi> reſolution, <note place="margin">Luther.</note>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was ſometime the complaint of one <hi>Drex, de cultu. conſc.</hi> that this is a miſery that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls us in the Miniſterie above all other callings whatſoever, that we can never find our work as we leave it: let a Plowman ſow his
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:115739:197"/> ſeed, and as he leaves his field, ſo he finds it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; <hi>dolabra ſemel dedolares,</hi> &amp;c. let a Joyner plain a board, and when he returns he ſees the fruit of his former la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; but if a Miniſter ſow the ſeed of the word, after his departure <hi>the enemie comes and ſows Tares;</hi> let him take never ſo much pains to plain and faſhion a people, yet after a while he finds a rough-caſt of corruption over them: let him take never ſo much care to lay firm the principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt, yet he ſhall find them ſoon <hi>moved away from the truths of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was the Apoſtles caſe here; he had with much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and many travelling pains planted this Church, but after his departure, <hi>there aroſe men of corrupt minds, ſpeaking perverſe things, defaming his miniſtery, and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his Doctrine:</hi> In this Epiſtle the Apoſtle juſtifies his perſon againſt their calumnies, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.2. and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms his Doctrine againſt all their Cavils, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.4,5.</p>
               <p>The principle that they oppoſe, is, Juſtification by the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, without an addition of the works of the Law: for it hath ever been the manner of falſe Teachers, they have loved mixture: This principle the Apoſtle labours to confirm them in, in theſe words, by ſetting before them the miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that they muſt needs be in that are under the Law in matter of Juſtification; they thereby become <hi>ſubject to bondage, children of the bond-woman, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the liberty wherein Chriſt hath made them free:</hi> and this he proves by ſetting before them an antient and known hiſtory, wherein he tels them a ſpiritual myſterie was contained: the hiſtory this; <hi>Abraham</hi> had in a manner two wives of different conditions, the one bond,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:115739:197"/> and the other free, and by theſe he had two ſons of like condition with their mothers; for the rule is, <hi>partus ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitur ventrem;</hi> the ſon of the free-woman was a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and the ſon of the bond-woman was a bond-man. This, the Apoſtle ſaith, is not to be taken barely as the letter ſounds and no more, but there is ſomething elſe meant then the words themſelves do repreſent unto a man <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

               <p>Would you ſee an example of both theſe ſons, the bond and the free? if you would ſee an example of <hi>Iſmael</hi> the ſon of the bond-woman, look upon <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem that now is,</hi> that is, the people of the Jews as they then ſtood affected, who did ſeek Juſtification by their own righteouſneſs, and expected eternal life by the works of the Law, and therefore they being under the firſt Covenant, which genders to bondage, they were in bondage alſo: ſee an example of <hi>Iſaac</hi> the ſon of the free-woman; look upon the Church planted by Chriſt and the Apoſtles, in the dares of the Goſpel, which dare not ſtand upon the righteonſneſs of the Law for Juſtification, but embrace the righteouſneſs of Chriſt alone, and truſt perfectly in the grace that God hath revealed in his Son; and this is called <hi>Ieruſalem that is above;</hi> as <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22. becauſe begotten from above, and have above their converſation; and of all free men, all regenerate men, this is acknowledged to be the mother, and they ſons of this Church in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> that is above.</p>
               <p>Some Interpreters I know ſay, that theſe two Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants are not two in ſubſtance, but that it is meant of the Covenant of grace diverſly adminiſtred under the Old Teſtament and under the New: in the one they were under Tutors and Governors, and ſo in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage till the time of liberty came that was appointed by the Father.</p>
               <p>I confeſs that this bondage is alſo ſpoke of in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3, 4. under the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Law, the rudiments of the world, and in compariſon of the Ordinances and liberties of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, <hi>beggerly Elements;</hi> but here the Apoſtle cannot ſpeak either that thoſe ſons, or thoſe mothers ſignifie
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:115739:198"/> the Covenant of grace diverſly adminiſtred for theſe two reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he ſpeaks of men under the Law as a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant under the ſame Covenant that <hi>Iſmael</hi> was, being as he was the <hi>ſon of the bond-woman,</hi> that did ſeek Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by the works of the Law, according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of this Covenant, <hi>This do and live:</hi> But the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God under the Old Teſtament, ſons under Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Governors in their minority, and under the pedagogy of <hi>Moſes,</hi> did not ſeek to be Juſtified by the Law, nor deſire to be under it, neither were they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame Covenant that <hi>Iſmael</hi> was, therefore it cannot be meant of the ſons of God under the Old Teſtament. And this forceth <hi>Calvin</hi> to reject this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, and to ſay, <note place="margin">Calvin.</note> 
                  <hi>Fateor Paulum hic de talibus ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liis non loqui:</hi> therefore it is ſpoken of two diſtinct Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, the Covenant of <hi>Iſmael,</hi> which was a Covenant of works, and the Covenant of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> which was the Covenant of grace.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſuch as being in the condition of <hi>Iſmael,</hi> were to expect no inheritance, but to be caſt out at laſt: <hi>Caſt out the bond-woman and her ſon, verſ.</hi> 30.

                  <hi>ult.</hi> taking the two mothers therefore, not for the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace diverſly adminiſtred; but for the two ſeveral Covenants that God hath made with mankind,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:115739:199"/> 
                  <hi>the Covenant of works,</hi> and <hi>the Covenant of grace:</hi> the purpoſe of the Holy-Ghoſt here I will ſet down in theſe propoſitions, worthy to be ſtudyed and enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into.</p>
               <p>Firſt, there are two ſeveral Covenants that God hath made with mankind, one of works, before the fall; and the other of grace, which ſince the fall God hath eſtabliſhed and revealed to the Church.</p>
               <p>Secondly, all thoſe that live in the Church are the children of one of theſe Covenants (that is) they be under them; for <hi>Abrahams</hi> family was a Type of the Church, and there were two mothers and two ſons. All carnal unregenerate perſons are <hi>ſcoffing I ſmaels,</hi> are the <hi>children of Hagar,</hi> they are under the firſt Covenant, the Covenant of works: all godly and regenerate men are the children of <hi>Sarah,</hi> that is, <hi>born of the promiſe,</hi> and under the Covenant of grace.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, all the liberty and bondage that a man ſtands in, proceeds from the Covenant under which he ſtands; he that is born of the bond-woman, whatever his pretences and priviledges be, he is a bond-man; and he that is born of the free-woman is a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Covenant of works, though it was at firſt given as a Covenant of liberty, and <hi>Adam</hi> under it was a free-man, yet unto man fallen it is a Covenant of bondage: and all unregenerate men that be under it are bond-men; but on the contrary, the Covenant of grace is a Covenant of freedom, and they that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it are free-men.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, to ſtand under the Covenant of works <hi>which genders to bondage,</hi> is unto all unregenerate men a deſirable condition: <hi>they deſire to be under the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="339" facs="tcp:115739:199"/>
               <p>Sixthly, the Law it ſelf which God delivered upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> though God did publiſh it there with Evangelical purpoſes, and had no intention to ſet it up as a Covenant of works, but only as a hand-maid, an appendix unto the Covenant of grace: and therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>whereto ſerves the Law, if it were not ſet forth as a Covenant by which man ſhould attain life? Gal.</hi> 3.19. he anſwers, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>it was added,</hi> or put to, not ſet up by it ſelf alone, as a diſtinct Covenant, but added as a hand-maid to advance the glory, and to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ends of the ſecond Covenant; yet even this Law unregenerate men in the Church make unto themſelves to be nothing elſe but a Covenant of works, and ſo though it were not given for bondage, <hi>yet in them it genders unto bondage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seventhly, no man can ſtand under both Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants: no more then he can be born of two mothers; he that is born of <hi>Hagar,</hi> cannot be naturally the Son of <hi>Sarah;</hi> and therefore if a man be under the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, there muſt be a tranſlation, and that ſupernatural, or elſe a man can never be a ſon of the free-woman, can never be under the ſecond Covenant.</p>
               <div type="doctrine">
                  <head>Doctrine.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>All unregenerate men, men in a ſtate of nature wherein they were born, are all under the firſt Covenant, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works; they be all the ſons of</hi> Hagar <hi>the bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman: Iſmael</hi> is a Type of all unregenerate men.</p>
                  <p>A Covenant is a mutual agreement between two, voluntarily binding themſelves upon certain conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons each to other.</p>
                  <p>Man is bound unto God by a double bond: Firſt, by the bond of Creation. Secondly, by the bond of ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:115739:200"/> the one natural, and the other voluntary, that ſo the Lord may bind the creature to him by all imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ingagements to prevent future apoſtacy: <hi>for the Lord knows our frame and whereof we were made:</hi> by the former we are only bound unto God; but by the latter God alſo is bound unto us, and as before I ſaid, he did it to engage the creature: ſo he doth this to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the creature to obedience: The Lord hath, as Creator, abſolute and unlimited authority, and therefore might have commanded duty without reward: for <hi>when we have done all that is commanded, we are but unprofitable ſervants:</hi> or if he had intended a reward, he might have reſerved that unto himſelf, and have told the creature, you ſhall truſt unto me: if I think fit, I will reward you: but however I will be free: But the Lord doth not: but that man might not think much to be bound unto obedience, God himſelf is pleaſed to be bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence: <hi>Haſt thou ſerved God for nought?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this agreement between God and man is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, anſwerable unto the two-fold ſtate of man; Firſt, in the ſtate of integrity God made with man a Covenant expreſſing mans duty, and promiſing a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward unto his obedience, and this was <hi>faedus amicitiae:</hi> becauſe God and man were not at variance, like that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jonathan</hi> for the confirmation of their mutual loves.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in a ſtate of corruption after the fall, God entred into a new Covenant to take man into friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip again, after God and man had by ſin been ſet at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance, and this was <hi>faedus miſericordiae,</hi> a Covenant of reconciliation.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, theſe two Covenants were made with two ſeveral heads: with the <hi>firſt</hi> and with the <hi>ſecond Adam;</hi>
                     <pb n="341" facs="tcp:115739:200"/> for under theſe all mankind are included; and in them the Lord looks upon the whole nature of man; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle ſpeaks as if there were but two men in the world, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.47. <hi>the firſt man, and the ſecond man:</hi> becauſe they are as the two common heads of all mankind.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Covenant was made with the <hi>firſt Adam, Gen.</hi> 2.9. <hi>God gave Adam all the Trees of the Garden for meat:</hi> but one was given as <hi>pabulum animae:</hi> called therefore <hi>non ab effectu,</hi> the tree of life: not becauſe of any natural power in it, either to beget or continue life: but, <hi>à ſignificatione quâ erat Sacramentum &amp; Symbolum vitae:</hi> as a ſign ſignifying, as a ſeal ratifying and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming to him the aſſurance of that life which God had promiſed unto his obedience: Now this was not a ſeal ſet to a blank: therefore it muſt needs be given up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuppoſition, and for confirmation of a fore-going Covenant.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Covenant was made with the ſecond <hi>Adam; he ſaith not unto ſeeds, as ſpeaking of many; but unto one, which is Chriſt, Gal</hi> 3.16,19. he is called <hi>the ſeed</hi> unto whom the promiſe, and with whom the Covenant was made: for as <hi>Adam</hi> was <hi>Caput cum faedere;</hi> ſo is Chriſt alſo, therefore the Lord promiſeth that he will give him <hi>as a Covenant to the Nations, Iſa.</hi> 4.2,6. for in this <hi>Adam</hi> was <hi>a Type of him that was to come,</hi> Rom. 5.14.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the firſt Covenant was a Covenant of works, ſo called from the condition of the Covenant which did require perſonal and perfect obedience; <hi>this do and thou ſhalt live, Ezek.</hi> 20.13. and that under a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of a curſe for the leaſt deviation; <hi>curſed is every one that continues not in all things written in the book
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:115739:201"/> of the Law to do them, Gal.</hi> 3.10.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, this Covenant was made not only with <hi>Adam,</hi> but with the whole nature of man in him, for <hi>Adam</hi> was a publike perſon, a repreſentative head; and the tree of life was not a perſonal Sacrament, but a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, which did belong unto the nature, and therefore the Covenant was made with the nature, and not with any particular perſon only; which doth appear plainly, becauſe the Covenant being broken, the curſe of the Covenant doth ſeiſe upon the nature, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. for the duty of the Covenant muſt needs be as large as the curſe of the Covenant; therefore upon whomſoever the curſe doth come, unto them the duty did belong, and none were bound unto the obedience of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, but they that were <hi>foederati,</hi> perſons with whom the Covenant was made.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, this Covenant is not aboliſhed by the fall, but remains and ſtands in force. Not to give life and ſalvation; that indeed it cannot do, becauſe <hi>it is become weak through the fleſh, Rom.</hi> 8.3. but it commands duty now, as perfectly as it did of <hi>Adam,</hi> and that muſt be perſonal and perfect obedience: And if a man fail in the leaſt degree, it threatens the curſe alſo. God ſpeaks unto <hi>Cain</hi> according to the tenure of this Covenant af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fall, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.7. <hi>if thou doſt well, ſhalt thou not be accepted? &amp;c.</hi> It is by vertue of this Covenant that the curſe comes upon men here in a degree, and in perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction hereafter. there is no reaſon, that becauſe we have loſt power to obey, therefore God ſhould loſe his power to command.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Laſtly all unregenerate men ſince the fall, do ſtand under this Covenant with the Lord: it muſt needs follow from the principles already laid: for if this
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:115739:201"/> Covenant were made with <hi>Adam,</hi> with the whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man, and if it ſtand in force ſince the fall, then whereſoever the nature of man is, becauſe every man is a Son of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> he muſt needs become bound unto the terms and condition of this Covenant; for it was made with the nature of man, and therefore it muſt be univerſal; yet that ſince the fall all unregenerate men are under this Covenant, I will further prove it by theſe Arguments</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it will appear from the conveyance of the guilt of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. <hi>As by one man ſin entred into the world and death by ſin, ſo death came upon all; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſin came upon all:</hi> how ſo, ſeeing there be many dye that do never ſin? The Apoſtle anſwers, though they have never ſinned in their own perſons, yet in him as a publike perſon they did ſin <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>in whom all have ſinned:</hi> we were all in him, and therefore we all ſinned in him: now how were men in <hi>Adam?</hi> they were in him two waies.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, legally by vertue of the Covenant which God made with him, we were parties therein; we were as well bound to the duty, had as true an intereſt in the mercy and life promiſed, and were as liable unto the curſe that ſhould follow upon the breach of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant as he, and therefore all mankind fell at once.</p>
                  <p>The Covenant it ſeems, that God made with the Angels, he did not make it with the whole Angelical nature, and therefore ſome of them fell and others ſtood, but ours being made with the whole humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and we being all involved in one Covenant, when in <hi>Adam</hi> our Covenant was broken, we all fell in him, and therefore ſpeaking of this Covenant, Saint <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom</hi> tells us, <note place="margin">Chryſoſt</note> 
                     <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the hand writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:115739:202"/> of <hi>Adams</hi> Covenant was ours, as truly as it was his.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, naturally, and ſo we bear the Image of the earthly, receiving from him the ſame nature that he had, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.49. if he had ſtood, he had conveyed unto us an undefiled nature, and we have from him a corrupt nature by the fall: ſo that <hi>whatever is born of the fleſh, is fleſh, Joh.</hi> 3.6. now ſeeing his ſin is conveyed unto us, becauſe we ſtood under the ſame Covenant with him, it muſt needs follow, that ſo long as a man ſtands guilty of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, ſo long he ſtands under <hi>Adams</hi> Covenant, and that muſt needs be till this ſin be done away in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to be freed from the Law as a Covenant of works, is in Scripture made a ſpecial favour, vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed unto none but them that are in Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. <hi>we are not under the Law, but under grace, Rom.</hi> 7.1,2,3. <hi>the Law is brought in as a dead husband,</hi> that hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand over a man no more, but it is <hi>Chriſt that cancels this hand-writing, Col.</hi> 2.14. it is <hi>a liberty wherein Chriſt hath made us free, Gal.</hi> 5.1. Now how hath Chriſt made us free from the Law? how is it done? and how are we not under the Law? the Law hath in Scripture divers uſes; <hi>Eſt inſtar Paedagogi, regulae, fraeni &amp; ſpeculi,</hi> now in all theſe reſpects believers are under the Law: it is not a <hi>hand-writing cancelled</hi> in either of them, but <hi>ſub ratione pacti:</hi> ſo they that are in Chriſt, are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, but under grace, that is, either for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, or life, for <hi>Chriſt is the end of the Law for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to every one that believeth, Rom.</hi> 10 4. If none are freed from the Law as a Covenant, but they that are in Chriſt, then all unregenerate men who are without Chriſt, they ſtand under the Law as a Coevnant ſtill.</p>
                  <pb n="345" facs="tcp:115739:202"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, God deals with all unregenerate men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the terms of the firſt Covenant: for God deals with and diſpenſeth himſelf unto men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto the Covenant under which they ſtand: and therefore we ſhall find the dealing with thoſe, and with believers is exceeding different, according as they ſtand under different Covenants.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he expects perfect obedience in their own perſons: indeed the Lord requires perfect obedience ſtill, and wherein we come ſhort in the leaſt degree, we ſin: but yet becauſe the perfection is not to be found in us, it is made up in the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> in the obedience of <hi>the beloved:</hi> for there is <hi>commutatio per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonae,</hi> but not <hi>Juſtitiae:</hi> but this is not vouchſafed unto any unregenerate man: neither a change of his righte ouſneſs, it muſt be perfect: nor of his perſon, for it muſt be perſonal righteouſneſs: for this Covenant ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits no Mediator: ſo that of all the obedience of Chriſt, not any goes to perfect their obedience, and of all his ſufferings not a drop of his blood goes to take away one of their ſins off the ſcore, for they are <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt, Eph.</hi> 2.12. and it is <hi>in him alone that God is well pleaſed, Math.</hi> 3.17.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he rejects their moſt glorious works for the leaſt failing in them; See it in <hi>Jehu,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10.30. God ſaith of him: <hi>He had diligently executed what was right in mine eyes: and hath done unto the houſe of Ahab according to all that was in my heart:</hi> and yet in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1.4. he ſaith, <hi>I will viſit the blood of Iezreel on the houſe of Jehu:</hi> and in them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1,11,12. though they were things commended by God, yet <hi>he abhors them; if thou doſt evil, ſin lies at thy door, Gen.</hi> 4.7. whereas it is not ſo with them that are under the Covenant of grace:
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:115739:203"/> I perſwade my ſelf many of their works are rewarded that have had (if you look upon the thing it ſelf) as great imperfections as there have been in thoſe works that unregenerate men have been puniſhed for; if there be <hi>a willing mind,</hi> though the work be not anſwerable, yet it ſhall be accepted, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12. and <hi>the good Lord will pardon a man though he be not cleanſed according to the purification of the Sanctuary,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.18,19.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he hates their perſons for their works ſake, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.7. <hi>if thou doſt well, ſhalt thou not be accepted:</hi> the perſon's curſed for the works ſake, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. but under the new Covenant it is the love of the perſons that makes their Services be accepted: <hi>Abels</hi> offering was offered with ſin as well as <hi>Cains,</hi> yet <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.4. <hi>God had reſpect to Abel, and</hi> then <hi>to his offering:</hi> but he reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not <hi>Cains</hi> offering becauſe he had no reſpect unto his perſon: the weakneſs of <hi>Abels</hi> perſon made not his ſervices rejected, but ſo it did <hi>Cains:</hi> God is angry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed at the ſins of the one: but there is <hi>ira ſimplex, &amp; ira redundans in perſonam:</hi> he doth never hate their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons when he is angry with their works: but he deals with the wicked under the firſt Covenant, hates their ſervices for their perſons ſake.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, all things are turned into a curſe to them that are under the firſt Covenant; for this Covenant deſerves nothing for the breakers thereof but the curſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. and <hi>they are curſed in the Basket and in the ſtore Deut.</hi> 28.7. <hi>their Table made a ſnare. Pſal.</hi> 69.22. <hi>curſe their bleſsings, Mal.</hi> 2.2. That Covenant being broken <hi>brings forth death:</hi> And theſe temporal Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are but the <hi>praeludia judicii futuri:</hi> but under the Covenant of grace, unto them all things are turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a bleſſing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. <hi>all things work together for good,</hi>
                     <pb n="347" facs="tcp:115739:203"/> by their Covenant; <hi>all things are yours, whether life or death,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22. Now this dealing of God with men living in the Church under the ſame Ordinances, and enjoying the ſame priviledges being ſo different, there can be no reaſon given of it, but meerly the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Covenants under which they ſtand: for God hath been and is <hi>alwaies mindful of his Covenant,</hi> and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, doth alwaies diſpence himſelf to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

                  <p>Let it awaken every natural man to ſeek for a tranſlation: Thy miſery by ſin ſtands in two things: Firſt, that thou art under <hi>Adams</hi> Covenant. Secondly, that thou beareſt his Image: now we many times ſee our miſery by the one, the evil of our waies: but few are ſenſible of the other, the evil of our ſtate; and that is the greateſt: for this makes thee a <hi>bond-man</hi> whileſt thou liveſt: for <hi>the Covenant genders unto bondage,</hi> and it cuts thee off from all hope of an inheritance here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: for <hi>the bond-woman muſt be caſt out with her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the tranſlation which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, <hi>being tranſlated into the Kingdom of his dear ſon, Col.</hi> 1.1. this <hi>is the paſſage from death to life, Iohn</hi> 5.24. In this paſſage a of man there muſt be a double change. Firſt, <hi>mutatio moralis:</hi> a Relative change, as when of a bond-man, a man is made a free-man: of a ſervant he becomes a ſon. Secondly, <hi>Phyſica:</hi> a natural change: that is, when of a ſick man he is made ſound; the firſt is the change of a mans Covenant, and the ſecond a change of his Image: the one is done in Juſtification; and the other in Sanctification: and by both theſe, <hi>old things are paſt away, all things do become new,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 5.17.
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:115739:204"/> This tranſlation all the people of God that ever went to heaven had experience of; and this is that I deſire all men in a natural ſtate may be awakened to ſeek after. But you will ſay, who be the men that ſtand under this firſt Covenant? I hope there be none ſuch amongſt us. You may judge your ſelves by theſe two rules.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he that is under the ſecond Covenant, hath an intereſt in him who is <hi>the prince of the Covenant;</hi> he that was <hi>given as a Covenant to the Nations, Iſa.</hi> 42.6. for we heard before that the two Covenants were made with two different heads; and it is union with them that brings a man under either Covenant; it is <hi>being in Adam</hi> that makes a man ſtand under the one: and <hi>being in Chriſt,</hi> that gives a man intereſt in the other: for a man muſt be in Chriſt as he was in <hi>Adam</hi> (that is) in him <hi>legally ſtanding under his Covenant:</hi> and in him <hi>naturally, that is bearing his Image.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if a man would know whether he hath an Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in Chriſt or no, let him take the Apoſtles rule, and lay it unto his own ſoul impartially, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. <hi>he that is in Chriſt, is a new creature:</hi> he is not barely new dreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or hath gotten a new out-ſide, but he is <hi>within re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in the Spirit of his mind:</hi> he hath a new under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, new apprehenſions of perſons and things; and thoſe things which before <hi>he counted fooliſhneſs,</hi> now he doth know them to be his only wiſdom; and thoſe perſons that he looked upon as the ſcum and off-ſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of all things, theſe they judge to be <hi>the excellent ones of the earth;</hi> and thoſe dark and carnal apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the waies of God, and the myſteries of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, that he had before, they are now done and paſt away, they have no affection to them: for it is not enough for a man to have new words, and new actions:
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:115739:204"/> there is many a man abſtains from the practiſe of many ſins that their hearts love: and many a man for ſome reſpects takes up the practiſe of ſome duties that his heart hates: but ſuch a man now loves that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hated, and he now hates that which before he did love: that which before was to him the only mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his joy, now becomes the only object of his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: thus <hi>he that is in Chriſt, is a new creature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If ſo, then ſurely they cannot take themſelves to be new creatures, that have not ſo much as renewed their actions: that were drunkards and ſo continue: were Sabbath-breakers, and Swearers, and Uſerers, and Scoffers, and ſo continue ſtill, the comfort of whoſe lives comes in by evil: it is their meat and drink: <hi>they eat the bread of wickedneſs and drink the wine of violence, Prov.</hi> 4.27. Its their cloathing: <hi>Pride compaſſeth them as a chain, violence covers them as a Garment, Pſal.</hi> 73.6. and it is their recreation: <hi>it is a paſtime for a fool to do wickedly, Prov.</hi> 10.23 and there be no recreations that have any pleaſure in them unleſs they be ſweetned by ſin: ſurely thus walking in their old waies, it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible they ſhould be new creatures; and not being new creatures, they are not in Chriſt; and not being in Chriſt, the Prince of the Covenant, they have no intereſt in the new Covenant.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he that is under the firſt Covenant, is a bond-man as <hi>Iſmael;</hi> whereas he that is under the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Covenant is the ſon of the free-woman, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives from the Lord by that Covenant a free Spirit, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.12.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he is in bondage by earthly engagements, he can have no engagement but it is a ſnare to him: The
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:115739:205"/> falſe Prophets were honoured by ſome of the Kings of Iſrael: therefore they could not ſpeak the truth to him, neither to reprove his ſin, nor to diſcover the mind of God. I muſt do ſuch a thing though it be againſt my conſcience, to give ſuch a man content: I muſt not reprove ſuch a ſin, becauſe it will diſpleaſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Michaiah</hi> had a diſ-engaged Spirit in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in bondage unto ſin and under the power of their own luſts, that though they may ſee many evils in themſelves, and confeſs it, yet when occaſion and opportunity ſerves, and the luſt repreſents it ſelf, they are no more their own, thy cannot reſiſt <hi>Eyes full of Adultery that cannot ceaſe to ſin.</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.14. <hi>and as men uſe to ſay, they cannot chooſe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in bondage unto the creatures under the power of them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.12. <hi>one man cannot live</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his honour, another without his minion, another without ſuch an eſtate: and all the thoughts of their hearts run out about ſuch things, and are wholly buſied about meat, and drink, and cloathes, and money, and play, and this wholly drinks up their ſpirits.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, in bondage under the guilt of ſin, and ſlaviſh and ſervile fears; they go all their life long with a galled conſcience, filled with fearful apprehenſions of death and Judgement: for <hi>they all their life long for fear of death are ſubject to bondage, Heb.</hi> 2.15.</p>
                  <p>Conſider ſeriouſly of theſe particulars: and unto ſuch men I ſpeak, as being as yet under the firſt Covenant; and I exhort them to ſeek to be tranſlated.</p>
                  <p>I ſpeak not this to make the firſt Covenant which God made with <hi>Adam,</hi> vile in your eyes.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, it was a great favour that God would be
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:115739:205"/> pleaſed to make a Covenant with the creature: for we did owe him ſervice, though he had never promiſed a reward.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the perſon with whom this Covenant was made, was the moſt excellent of any meer man: never any ſo full of perfections as he: ſo fit to be head, and ſo likely to convey grace unto us, as <hi>Adam</hi> was; and therefore the Lord made the beſt choice for us for the eſtabliſhing of this Covenant: for had we our ſelves been to chuſe, ſeeing his perfections, we would rather have put the keeping of our happineſs into his hands, then have kept it in our own.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, there were great things promiſed by this Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.9. all the good things of this life, and eternal happineſs with God in the life to come.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it was the ſame Covenant that God made with the beſt of the creatures, even the glorious Angels: they ſtood by it, and owe their happineſs to it at this day: which appears by Gods dealing with the Angels that fell: <hi>he caſt them off for one tranſgreſsion, Jude</hi> 6. and they that ſtood, ſtood by vertue of the ſame Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant which they broke that fell: and by vertue of that Covenant being now confirmed in their eſtate, <hi>they daily behold the face of your Father which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, to put an end to all: it is the ſame Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that the Lord Chriſt himſelf ſtood under: <hi>for he was made under the Law, Gal.</hi> 4.4. that is, not only the Ceremonial and Judicial Law, as a Jew, but as a man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo under the moral Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. being bound to his obedience, and to ſuffer the curſe thereof: for <hi>he was our ſurety, Heb.</hi> 7.22. and the ſurety is bound in the
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:115739:206"/> ſame bond with the principal; and therefore <hi>he was made a curſe for us:</hi> which is the proper fruit of the Law as a Covenant of works, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. in all theſe reſpects it was a glorious Covenant.</p>
                  <p>But men ſhould be awakened to ſeek to be tranſlated, whether we look upon this Covenant, and mans ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under it in his ſtate of innocency, or in the ſtate of ſin.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in the ſtate of innocency, ſo if he had ſtood, he might well have deſired to have been tranſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ted out of this Covenant, if we conſider it and compare it with the Covenant of grace.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this was a Covenant made with a mutable head; <hi>Adam,</hi> though he were an excellent creature, yet he was but a creature: and it is true of all men, that <hi>they were given to change, Prov.</hi> 24.21. now for a man to have all his happineſs inbarked in a creature daily ſubject unto change, muſt needs imply an imperfection in their condition: but the Covenant of grace is made with Chriſt an unchangable head, and therefore <hi>becauſe he lives, we ſhall live alſo, Ioh.</hi> 14.19.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Covenant it ſelf was a changeable Covenant, and therefore by reaſon of ſin there is a change thereof unto all that believe: and the Lord hath introduced a <hi>ſecond and a better Covenant;</hi> but the Covenant of grace <hi>is an everlaſting Covenant, Gen.</hi> 17.7. <hi>a ſure Covenant,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.1,2. ſo that nothing can ariſe <hi>de novo,</hi> to diſannul it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q rend="inline">Fourthly, the promiſes of this Covenant were far in feriour unto thoſe in the Covenant of grace: it is <hi>a Covenant eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes, Heb.</hi> 8.6. in this indeed God did promiſe life here and hereafter, but he did not promiſe, <hi>I will be thy God: I will give
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:115739:206"/> thee my Son: and I will give thee my Spirit; I will be thy God:</hi> that is, all the Attributes that be in me, ſhall be as truly thine for thy good, as they be mine for my own glory: thou ſhalt have my wiſdom to direct thee, my power to protect thee; if thou ſin, thou ſhalt have my mercy to pardon, my grace to rule, and my glory to crown thee.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, the righteouſneſs of this Covenant was a far leſs glorious righteouſneſs; for it ſhould have been <hi>the works of righteouſneſs that we had done, Tit.</hi> 3.5. but the righteouſneſs of a creature: but the righteouſneſs of the ſecond Covenant is the righteouſneſs of God himſelf, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. not the eſſential righteouſneſs of God; but a righteouſneſs anſwerable unto the Law, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which the God-head gave both efficacy and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, the Condition of this Covenant was leſs glorious: for it was Doing; but the Condition of the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> was believing; and this is moſt glorious, becauſe it ſets a man upon the higheſt way of glorifying God; for all acts of obedience in <hi>Adam</hi> did but glorifie God in his Law; but this is glorifying of God in his Son; which is the higheſt glory, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.29.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Laſtly, the power of performance was far inferiour: for that was to be done by man alone, by the ſtrength of grace received without any further ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply; and grace unaſſiſted, what can it do? but under the ſecond Covenant, though the work be to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by us, yet the ſupply of ſtrength is Gods; <hi>it is God that works in us both to w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ll and to do, Phil</hi> 2.13.</p>
                  <p>Thus if we look upon man in his integrity under this Covenant, he hath reaſon, ſeeing the new Covenant is offered, to deſire to be tranſlated.</p>
                  <pb n="354" facs="tcp:115739:207"/>
                  <p>Secondly, but if we look upon man as fallen, then all thoſe that ſtand under this Covenant have reaſon to be awakened, to be tranſplanted.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, by vertue of this Covenant, ſin is imputed and laid upon a mans own ſcore; <hi>Noxa ſequitur caput; the ſoul that ſins ſhall dye, Gen.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Sin lies at thy door;</hi> ſo that thou though haſt heard talk of the death and ſuffering of Chriſt yet, not a drop of his blood ſhall go to take off one ſin, or one torment from thee: for thy Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant admits no commutation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is a Covenant without a Mediator: for then there needed no middle perſon; <hi>no daies-man to lay hold upon both, Iob</hi> 5.9. ſo now ſince man is fallen, all that ſtand under this Covenant converſe with God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, they have no Mediator to bear their ſins, or to offer their ſacrifices.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, to offer their ſacrifices, ſo that in all their ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they come unto God immediately; Firſt, thou haſt none to bring thee into the preſence of God, whereas by the ſecond Covenant we have <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>boldneſs and acceſs, Eph.</hi> 3.12. we have a manuduction to the Father by him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when we come to God we have no Prieſt to offer our ſacrifices, and ſo they can never be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto the Lord; for whoſoever ſhould offer a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of himſelf without a Prieſt, <hi>that ſoul was to be cut off from his people.</hi> Yet this is your condition under the ſecond Covenant.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, there is none to perfume them, and take away the failings of them; <hi>to bear the iniquity of your holy things, Exod.</hi> 28.38. to perfume your prayers, to waſh your tears: <hi>Lava lachrymas meas Domine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, if Satan object any thing againſt thee,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:115739:207"/> thou haſt none to make anſwer for thee, for thy Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant admits no advocate.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, if any ſervices be required, thou haſt none to help thee, but thy own might; no <hi>Chriſt to ſtrengthen thee;</hi> no <hi>Spirit to help thy infirmities, Rom.</hi> 8.26. as it is with the people of God in the Covenant of grace.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, none to bear thy ſins, or ſufferings; and ſo wrath muſt needs come upon thee immediately; it comes upon the godly under the ſecond Covenant, and Chriſt the Mediator ſtepped between, &amp; <hi>he bare the curſe, being made a curſe for us, Gal.</hi> 3.13. but when the Lord ſhall come to pour out his wrath upon thee, thou maieſt rather hope to prevail with the <hi>Rocks</hi> and the <hi>Mountains,</hi> then with Chriſt; he will not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear for thee, but thou muſt wraſtle it out with the wrath of the great God for ever; and <hi>it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God, Heb.</hi> 10.30,31. there muſt needs <hi>be Iudgement without mercy, and fury without compaſsion,</hi> when the Lord will ſtir up all his wrath, and none ſtep in to bear one drop of this ſtorm for thee; for thy Covenant admits no Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is a Covenant under which unto man fallen there is no hope of reparation; Firſt, it promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no repentance after ſinning: it belon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Covenant, that <hi>Chriſt ſhall give repentance unto Iſrael, Acts</hi> 5.31.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it promiſeth no ſpace to repent, but <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. <hi>the day thou eateſt thou ſhalt dye;</hi> and ſo they had, had not Chriſt ſtept in, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.21. ſpace to repent is not from the firſt Covenant.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if a man did repent, this Covenant promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:115739:208"/> no acceptation upon repentance; it ſaith indeed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.7. <hi>if thou doſt well thou ſhalt be accepted:</hi> but it faith not, if thou doſt evil thou ſhalt upon after repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance be accepted: therefore this is a mans miſerable condition, and this it muſt be by this Covenant for ever therefore the Devils are in a hopeleſs Condition, becauſe the Covenant under which they ſtand offers them no mercy after ſinning: and God hath not reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto them any other Covenant; and the ſame is the condition of every man by this firſt Covenant: only men have this priviledge, that they have a ſecond Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant offered unto them, upon which they may lay hold with hope of mercy: therefore neglect not theſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious offers: <hi>ſeek the Lord while he may be found:</hi> cloſe with the grace in the new Covenant; <hi>know the day of thy viſitation;</hi> for if thou be found at the laſt day under <hi>Adams</hi> Covenant and untranſlated, thou muſt expect no other, but to bear thy own ſin and ſhame for ever.</p>
                  <p>Let this awaken you to ſeek, firſt for a change of thy Covenant; and then afterward for a change of thine Image: many men labour to change their waies, and to abſtain from many ſins: but whileſt thou art under this firſt Covenant, thy Covenant promiſeth no grace to perform duties; thy Covenant promiſeth no acceptance; therefore the firſt thing that a ſoul ſhould ſet upon, is to ſeek to God to be tranſlated out of that Covenant, that bondage under which by nature he ſtands.</p>

<pb n="359" facs="tcp:115739:209"/> boſom of love from whence it flows: it is indeed the habitation of God, that next to heaven he delighteth to dwell in: <hi>he inhabiteth the praiſes of Iſrael.</hi> Theſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations I deſire to premſe, that you may a little ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve of what weight and importance the ſervices that you now go about are.</p>
               <p>For the words that I have read to you, that you may find out the meaning and ſcope of the Holy-Ghoſt in them, it is neceſſary that we look into the ſtory, the context, and the connexion of the verſe, which I ſhall briefly give you, and I intreate you diligently to mark: The Babylonian Monarchie having trodden down the City of God, the holy City, and laid waſt the Temple, and worſhip of God for ſeventy years: that time being expired, the Lord according to his promiſe, <hi>delivers his priſoners out of the pit in which there was no water.</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance was proclaimed by <hi>Cyrus</hi> the firſt King of <hi>Perſia:</hi> this liberty ſome of the Jews undervlaued, and they ſtill choſe rather to abide in the Land of their captivity: to them is the ſpeech directed in the 6. <hi>ver.</hi> of this Chapter, <hi>Ho, ſaith God, come forth, and ſtie from the Land of the North:</hi> they might have had liberty, but they embraced their former bondage: thoſe that did accept of deliverance, and returned into their own Countrie, they were no ſooner returned, but there roſe <hi>a Samaritan faction,</hi> their neighbours, thoſe that were neither Gentiles by profeſſion, nor Jews by religion: theſe did labour to their utmoſt to retard the ſettlement of this people newly returned into their own Land again, laboured to keep the City and Temple in their ruines, and to that end by their intereſt and power in forraign Nations, they had engaged againſt them, even the whole authority of the <hi>Perſian Monarchie.</hi> Now,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:115739:210"/> when the hopes of the enemy grew high, and when the hearts of the Saints fell low: what is the way God takes to remove them now? why now a Prophet muſt go to them, he ſendeth <hi>Zachariah the Prophet,</hi> and bids them, <hi>Return to your ſtrong holds ye priſoners of hope:</hi> your ſtrong holds? why, their City was laid waſt, their Temple burnt with fire: ſtrong holds they had none: <hi>ſatis praeſidii, in un Deo,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Calvin.</note> 
                  <hi>Calvin.</hi> There is enough ſtrength in one God, even then when walls and fortifications fall. Why now, that the Lord might bear up their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in this condition, he reveals his mind (as the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Lord was in thoſe times) unto his Prophet by ſeveral Viſions: in an eſpecial manner in this Chap. and the latter end of the former Chap. he doth it in a double viſion. In one, the Lord tels him, that be the powers of the enemy what they would be, though they ſaw no help, none to oppoſe them: yet the Lord would raiſe up an adverſe power that ſhould break them, though they knew not whence it ſhould come: And he tels them in the 21. <hi>ver.</hi> of the former Chap. <hi>there were four horns that did puſh Ieruſalem:</hi> and the Lord ſaith, <hi>I will raiſe up four Carpenters, and they ſhall beat them in pieces:</hi> equal to the horns, ſo ſhall the Carpenters be.</p>
               <p>In the next place, in this Chapter, the Lord ſhews him another viſion, <hi>a man with a line in his hand taking me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the City Ieruſalem, and of the Temple,</hi> as the manner of Builders and Artificers is to do. Jeſus Chriſt doth uſually appear to his people according to thoſe great things that he is about to effect for them: when the people were to be carried into Captivity, Jeſus Chriſt then appears <hi>cloathed in linnon, with a writers Inkhorn by his ſide, Ezek.</hi> 9.1,2. <hi>and when the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:115739:210"/> of vengeance come, Ieſus Chriſt comes in the midſt of them: the man with a writers Inkhorn was in the midſt of them:</hi> what to do? <hi>to mark thoſe that were written to life in Ieruſalem.</hi> Firſt, before the inſtruments of vengeance can ſtretch out their hands againſt any, the man with a writers Inkhorn will ſet his mark upon thoſe that are written for life: But when the people returned out of captivity, now Jeſus Chriſt appears <hi>with a line in his hand,</hi> for he it is that muſt build the Church: ſo you have it in the 6. Chap. 12. ver. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the man whoſe name is the Branch, he ſhall build thee, he ſhall build the Temple of the Lord:</hi> no wonder then, that when the Temple and City is to be built, Jeſus Chriſt appears <hi>with a line in his hand.</hi> This is the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>Now obſerve in this Chapter three things, that I may bring you home to the words read to you.</p>
               <p>Firſt, you have the Viſion it ſelf: <hi>the man with a line in his hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, you have the interpretation of the Viſion: <hi>Ieruſalem ſhall be built, and the City ſhall be inhabited.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, you have a threefold Apoſtrophe that the Lord infers from this.</p>
               <p>Firſt, directed unto the Jews that yet continued in <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Lord calls them; <hi>deliver thy ſelf Oh Sion, that dwelleſt with the daughter of</hi> Babylon.: It is barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and lowneſs of ſpirit not to accept deliverance: it is pitty but thoſe men that ſay <hi>they love their Task<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters, they ſhould have their ears bored,</hi> as a token of perpetual ſervice. The Lord calls upon them, <hi>Oh Sion that dwelleſt with the daughter of</hi> Babylon, <hi>deliver thy ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="362" facs="tcp:115739:211"/>
               <p>Secondly, the next is to the enemies that were their neighbours: the truth is my Brethren, it was a good obſervation that of <hi>Tertullian</hi> unto the Church; <note place="margin">Tertul.</note> there are <hi>tot hoſtes quot extranei;</hi> all that be ſtrangers, be ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; now the Lord ſpeaks unto theſe, and tells them, <hi>I will ſhake my hand againſt you, and they that ſpoyl you, they ſhall be a ſpoyl to their ſervants;</hi> their own ſervants ſhall ſpoil them.</p>
               <p>The third and laſt branch of this Apoſtrophe is in the words that I have read unto you; the words of the Text, and it referrs partly to the enemies; and partly to the people of God that were returned out of cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity: <hi>be ſilent Oh all fleſh; for the Lord is raiſed up out of his holy habitation:</hi> Let the enemies ſilence their mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings, ſilence their ſlanders: <hi>Be ſilent Oh all people.</hi> Let the Saints ſilence their frettings, ſilence their doubtings, <hi>for the Lord is raiſed up out of his boly habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You have then in the words two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt a Propoſition; <hi>The Lord is raiſed up out of his holy habitation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, an inference by way of Exhortation, or Command thereupon: <hi>Be ſilent before the Lord, Oh all fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Propoſition is firſt in nature, though it be laſt in place: and therefore I muſt firſt ſpeak of that, and then afterwards of the Application.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, the Propoſition is this: <hi>the Lord is raiſed up out of the habitation of his holineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here are two things to be explained before I can come unto thoſe points that I purpoſed to commend to you.</p>
               <pb n="363" facs="tcp:115739:211"/>
               <p>Firſt, I muſt ſhew you what is meant by <hi>the habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his holineſs:</hi> And,</p>
               <p>Secondly, I muſt ſhew you how the Lord is ſaid to <hi>be raiſed up.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The habitation of his holineſs is uſed two waies in the Scripture. It is ſometimes put for heaven; in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. <hi>ult.</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>their prayer came up to his holy habitation,</hi> even unto heaven. So in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63 15. <hi>look down from the habitation of thy holineſs, and thy glory:</hi> why then the habitation of the holineſs of God, is <hi>Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, it is many times put for the <hi>Temple,</hi> the place of Gods preſence amongſt his people, manifeſted in Ordinances: ſo <hi>the Tabernacle</hi> is called <hi>Gods habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.29. And <hi>the Lord</hi> is ſaid <hi>to be at Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Bruſius.</note> 
                  <hi>Bruſius</hi> interpreteth it of the former. <note place="margin">Calvin.</note> Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> of the latter; we may very well by way of ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion take in both, for I conceive the ſenſe will be made up with both: all the Churches deliverances, as well as all the enemies deſtructions, they come out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: <hi>the ſword is bathed in heaven before it comes down upon the people of Gods curſe in Iudgement,</hi> in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 34.3. and yet all theſe, whether deliverances, or deſtructions, are obtained by the prayers of the Saints in <hi>the Temple:</hi> ſo that you may well aſcribe it to both. Obſerve I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, and it is a mighty truth: the Saints have as glorious a hand in the Government of the world, as they ſhall have an eminent hand in the Judgement of the world. There is a threefold Authority that was erected by Chriſt when the government was taken into the hand of the <hi>Son</hi> as <hi>Mediator.</hi> Firſt, a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Angels: <hi>the ſpirit of the living creatures is in the wheels, Ezek.</hi> 1.20. Had not Jeſus Chriſt had the
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:115739:212"/> Government in his hand, the Angels ſhould never have been <hi>principalities and powers;</hi> their authority came in with the Government of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Authority and Government of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and Miniſters came in with the ſecond Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: <note place="margin">Auguſt.</note> 
                  <hi>iſtud nomen culpa meruit non natura:</hi> ſo <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> But there is, another kind of Government.</p>
               <p>And that is, the Saints being taken into Covenant with Chriſt, they have a great hand with him in the Government of Chriſt: in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.18. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>their ſound is gone forth into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.</hi> This is ſpoken of the <hi>Sun,</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. how can this be applyed to the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel? I conceive the accommodation runs thus: As the great God hath ſtretched out the <hi>Expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum caeli ſuper mundum naturalem,</hi> the heaven over the natural world, ſo he hath ſtretched forth the glorious <hi>Expanſum verbi ſuper mundum rationalem,</hi> the word over the rational world: Now be pleaſed to conſider, when the people of God put Propheſies and Promiſes in ſuit, beholding the ſeveral conjunctions &amp; aſpects of them in the world, truly, thoſe things that are done by Gods power, they are done alſo by their prayers: they have a ſtrange hand in the Government of all things. There is a double voice in the Book of the <hi>Rev. vox e throno: vox e templo:</hi> You read of <hi>a voice out of the Throne: and a voice out of the Temple:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Bright.</note> Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber puts this difference, and hath this hint, <hi>vox e thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> ſaith he, is that, <hi>quando immediate aliquid à Deo proficiſcitur,</hi> when any thing comes from God imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately: But <hi>vox e Templo, quando precibus ſanctorum aliquid Impetratur:</hi> that is, when any thing is obtained by the prayers of the Saints, <hi>that is a voice in the
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:115739:212"/> Temple.</hi> Now I intreate you to obſerve, this is the firſt thing: This <hi>holy habitation is</hi> heaven, in the Text. The Lord ſetteth ſo high a price upon the ſervices of the Saints, that they have a very great hand with him in the Government of all things. It is <hi>Augiſtines</hi> ſpeech that I have met withal ſometimes in <hi>Luther:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Auguſt.</note> he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth, <hi>aliquid bonum opus licet agreſte &amp; ſordidiſsimum eſt pretioſius caelo &amp; terra:</hi> the meanſt good work of the Saints, be it never ſo poor, never ſo ordinary, he ſaith, it is more precious then Heaven and Earth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> there is more in it, becauſe it hath ſo great a power with God: it is no wonder: then if the Lord be ſaid to be raiſed up in his Temple. Well, that is the firſt thing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, but how is God ſaid to <hi>be raiſed up?</hi> how can it be ſaid that God ſhould riſe? the word in the Original that is here uſed <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> it ſignifies <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ſomno ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citari,</hi> for a man to be raiſed up out of ſleep; the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame word that you have uſed in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.23. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Awake Lord, why ſleepeſt thou?</hi> awake Lord, or ariſe Lord: for it is ſuch a riſing as is after an awaking out of ſleep. How can God be ſaid to ſleep? and how ſhould God be ſaid to awake and riſe? The ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of acts of providence is Gods ſleep: the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of them forth is Gods ariſing, Gods awaking: as when a man ſleepeth, ſleep bindeth up his ſenſes in reference to their proper objects, that they cannot act: why ſo? when the Lord doth not act, doth not appear for his people, then is the Lord ſaid to ſleep: when he doth act for them, and providence puts forth it ſelf glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, now the Lord is ſaid to be raiſed up, God is awake. Now obſerve I pray you: when the Lord breaketh the deſigns of the Churches enemies, when <hi>he bloweth upon their counſels, ſmiteth them in the hinder
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:115739:213"/> parts,</hi> puts them to a perpetual ſhame, why <hi>then doth the Lord ariſe as a Giant refreſhed with wine, Pſal.</hi> 78.65. So that now the meaning is this; When the Lord doth appear for his people as a return of their prayers, when the Lord ariſeth gloriouſly for them for their deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and their enemies overthrow, then it is ſaid, <hi>the Lord is raiſed up out of his holy habitation.</hi> But I muſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten.</p>
               <p>The Obſervations that I ſhall give you from hence, are two.</p>
               <div type="doctrines">
                  <p>
                     <label>Doct. 1.</label> The firſt is this, <hi>The great comfort of the Saints in all their ſtraits and difficulties lies in this, when they ſee God ariſeth for them;</hi> for here is that now that they have pitched upon to comfort themſelves with. I ſay, the great comfort of the Saints in all their ſtraits and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, and difficulties, is in this, when they ſee God ariſe for them in his providential actings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Doct. 2:</label> Secondly, <hi>Experiments of Gods riſing in acts of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence are great grounds to his people to ſtay their fait<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, that God will go on, he will bring his work to perfection:</hi> for both theſe, (I conceive) are intended in the Text: <hi>God is raiſed up,</hi> therefore fear not, though you have no men riſing; God already hath manifeſted that he is raiſed up; do not doubt but he will carry on the work. Theſe two things I conceive the Lord intendeth in the words: And this I mean to make the Doctrinal part of this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. I pray obſerve them.</p>
                  <p>I will begin with the firſt: It is the great comfort of the Saints in the midſt of all their difficulties and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, to ſee God ariſe for them in his providential actings. In the opening of it I ſhall ſpeak to three heads.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, there is a time when God ſeems to ſleep: when

<pb n="368" facs="tcp:115739:214"/> ſpiritual failings, ſo doth the Lord towards his people in his providential actings. Well, that is the firſt thing for the opening of the Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The great labour of the Saints in all their ſtraits is to awaken God, <hi>that God may ariſe;</hi> their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is not to raiſe armies, and forces, powers of men; no my Beloved; their great buſineſs therefore is to raiſe up God, <hi>Pſal,</hi> 68.1. <hi>Let God ariſe, and let his enemies be ſcattered:</hi> whether any body elſe riſe or no, that is nothing: <hi>Let God ariſe;</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.23. <hi>Awake Lord, why ſleepeſt thou? ſtand up for my help, lay hold of the ſpear:</hi> (I, God muſt do it) <hi>and ſtop the wayes: O, ſtand up for my help:</hi> the great buſineſs of the Saints hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies been to raiſe up God; <hi>Awake, awake, put on ſtrength, O arm of the Lord,</hi> that is the Churches prayer. <hi>Art not thou he that didſt cut</hi> Rahab, <hi>and wound the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon?</hi> it is ſpoken of the deſtruction of the King of <hi>Egypt:</hi> the great buſineſs of Saints hath been alwaies to get God to ariſe. There are two things commonly awaken God: two things cauſe him to riſe up preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The one is the prayers of the Saints; <hi>Becauſe of the crie of the poor, and of the ſighing of the needy, I will riſe, ſaith the Lord, Pſal.</hi> 12.5. the truth is my Brethren, God cannot ſleep when you pray: it was a golden ſpeech that of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Tertul.</note>

                     <hi>Baſil.</hi> We knock at Heaven gates, we environ God, beleguer God by our prayers, we as it were wreſt mercy out of his hands. Be pleaſed to conſider this is one means: when the Diſciples were in the ſtorm at Sea, what was their great buſineſs? their great buſineſs was <hi>to awaken Chriſt,</hi> and then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately the ſtorm was over, <hi>and there followed a great
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:115739:214"/> calm,</hi> and they were at the Haven where they would be: God is awakened with the prayers of the Saints.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Lord he is awakened likewiſe by the blaſphemies of the enemies: truly, you have many times, even my Brethren, beheld how that the very end of Gods riſing for you, was becauſe of the rage of the enemy; <hi>I will awake and ſet him at reſt from him that puffeth at him,</hi> becauſe of the rage of the enemy: the enemies cruelty doth cry loud in the ears of God, as well as the Saints prayers: Now this being the great end that the people of God propound, truly when God ariſeth they are ſatisfied: let God ariſe, and they can ſit down ſecure, be the difficulties and oppoſitions what they will be: <hi>in fine acquieſcit appetitus efficientis.</hi> It was a ſtrange ſpirit that poſſeſſed <hi>Steven</hi> you will ſay, that he was able to lie down to ſleep when the ſtones flew about his ears: <hi>having ſo ſaid, he fell aſleep:</hi> what is the reaſon? why, <hi>I ſee heaven opened, and Jeſus ſtanding at the right hand of God:</hi> Chriſt was up for him: Chriſt ſtanding; why, Chriſt is ſaid to ſit at the right hand of God; how doth <hi>Steven</hi> ſee him ſtanding? ſtanding <hi>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam ſui ſudex, &amp; vindex,</hi> as one that would judge, and one that would avenge his quarrel; and truly he could lie down and ſleep ſecurely. <hi>Lord Jeſus receive my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and when he had ſo ſaid he fell aſleep.</hi> The great buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Saints then in all their difficulties is to get God to ariſe: that is the ſecond thing.</p>
                  <p>In the third place: The conſolations of the Saints muſt needs be very great from the ariſings of God for them in his providential actings; though men do not riſe, though Armies do not riſe, yet I ſay, they are mighty conſolations to ſee God ariſe. And that
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:115739:217"/> upon theſe three grounds, Obſerve them I pray you.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place: When the Lord doth ariſe, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſtandeth in oppoſition muſt fall: God will riſe up alone, that aſſure your ſelves; whatſoever ſtands in oppoſition I ſay, muſt fall; yet many times poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures we look upon Armies, and multitudes of men, and we think now, Oh alas, here is now no hope, but the Church will preſently be overwhelmed: mark; you have ſeen ſometimes a black ſmoke ariſe out of a Chimney, that you would think it would threaten even to darken the Sun in its orb: but mark, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 13.3. <hi>I wilſcatter them ſaith God, as ſmoke out of a chimney</hi> when you ſee Nations and multitudes combine, they are <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate as thorns:</hi> when you ſee them confident, <hi>drunk</hi> with confidence <hi>as the Drunkard, then ſhall they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed like ſtubble fully dry, Nahum</hi> 1.10. it was a good intimation that of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Cyprian.</note> 
                     <hi>ne attendas numerum:</hi> never obſerve the number: they be ſo many thouſands, and ſo many thouſands: certainly when God ariſeth, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſtands in oppoſition muſt fall, for God will riſe alone; that is the firſt ground of the Saints con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when God ariſeth, he over-ruleth the ſpirits of men, over-ruleth the malignity of the ſpirits of men, ſo as they ſhall effect and accompliſh his end: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ou may ſee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76.9,10. <hi>When God ſhall ariſe to Judgment, the wrath of man ſhall praiſe him: verily, and the mainder of wrath thou ſhalt reſtrain;</hi> my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, though we conſider little of it, yet we owe very much to reſtraining grace; I ſay we owe very much to reſtraining grace<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> in the Saints indeed I conceive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining grace and renewing grace to be one and the
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:115739:217"/> ſame habit, as Juſtifying faith and Hiſtorical faith is; the Saints owe very much to reſtraining grace; that in their own perſons; but they owe much to reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace in reference unto others. This is exerciſed two wayes.</p>
                  <p>There are reſtraints upon mens actions, and there are reſtraints upon mens luſts: God reſtrains not the Devils luſts, he lets them out to the utmoſt, but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains his actings: but for men, the Lord ſometimes reſtrains their acts, and ſometimes their luſts: <hi>No man ſhall deſire thy Land:</hi> God would lay a reſtraint upon their luſts: now when God ariſeth, then I ſay, he ſo orders the ſpirits of men, that ſo much of their rage ſhall be let out as ſhall accompliſh his ends, <hi>and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder he will reſtrain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the third place, the Saints have a great comfort in Gods riſing for them upon this ground; when God ariſeth, he hath abundance riſe with him: I ſay, if the Lord old riſe alone, he is able to do it; but whenſoever he ariſeth, he hath aboundance riſe with him: <hi>When the Lyon roars, all the Beaſts of the forreſt trembl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>:</hi> Obſerve I pray you: when the Lord comes to Judgement againſt a people, if he doth but ſay, <hi>cauſe the inſtruments of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance to draw neer, they come every man with a ſlaughter weapon in his hand immediately;</hi> Ezek. 9.1. ſo when the Lord riſeth up to execute vengeance upon an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: I will give you but one place; but it is a very glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Scripture, obſerve it I pray you, <hi>Dan.</hi> 10.20. there is an Angel come to comfort <hi>Daniel,</hi> and inſtruct him, and he tells you: now ſaith he, <hi>I go forth againſt the King of</hi> Perſia, <hi>and when I am gone forth, the Prince of</hi> Grecia <hi>ſhall come:</hi> mark, <hi>God riſeth up,</hi> as the Text tells you (for it referrs to the ſame) when God riſeth up
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:115739:216"/> once, then truly there is an Angel up, and together with him, all the power of the Grecian Monarchie; <hi>When I am gone forth</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>then the Prince of</hi> Grecia <hi>ſhall come;</hi> mighty wars there were between the <hi>Grecian</hi> and the <hi>Perſian,</hi> until the <hi>Perſian</hi> were ſubdued before him: Now, how came it to paſs? the Angel went out firſt to fight againſt the King of <hi>Perſia:</hi> when God riſeth up, then I ſay there be abundance riſe with him. Theſe are the grounds of the conſolation that the people of God did take from the riſing of God in his providential actings for them. There is a word more that I would ſpeak to. A queſtion will riſe now in every one of your mouths.</p>
                  <p>Oh, But how ſhould a people know? when by his ſpiritual eyes can he diſcern that God is raiſed up? we ſee men riſe, an arm of fleſh: but how ſhall we be able to ſay, <hi>God is raiſed up out of his holy habitation;</hi> that were comfort indeed, if we could conclude that: but what if men riſe without God?</p>
                  <p>Why now, in anſwer to that, I intreate you give me leave a little. When God is raiſed up for a people, he uſeth to cauſe <hi>magnam conjunctionem,</hi> a great combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as it were, and a joyning together of theſe five things (obſerve them, I beſeech you) and truly I think we may ſpeak it with thankfulneſs to the glorious praiſe of our God they have very far concurred in the Lords riſing among his people in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, When the Lord is awakened by prayer, that is the firſt thing; prayer is Gods way by which he is raiſed up, <hi>Iob</hi> 8.5,6. <hi>If thou make thy ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to him, he will ſurely awake for thee: If thou make thy ſupplication to him:</hi> what is the reaſon that God was raiſed up for his people here? he was raiſed up by prayer:
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:115739:216"/> look into <hi>Zach.</hi> 11.12,13. <hi>the Lord Chriſt</hi> he comes, and prayeth, <hi>how long will it be ere thou have compaſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon Ieruſalem, againſt whom thou haſt had indignation theſe three-ſcore and ten years?</hi> why now what is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn? <hi>The Lord anſwereth the Angel with good words, with comfortable words, I am jealous for Sion:</hi> as ſoon as ever Chriſt prayeth, my Brethren, he prayes your prayers: if ever prayer ariſe, God ariſeth: <hi>I am jealous for my people.</hi> That is the firſt. You ſhall know when God ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, if he be awakened by prayer: and truly, we had cauſe to hope in the beginning of our troubles, that the Lord did pour a large meaſure, a plentiful meaſure of the Spirit of prayer upon his people.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when the Lord defeateth the counſels of the enemy, turns their plots upon their heads: I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you obſerve; <hi>the Lord is known by the judgements that he executeth, when the wicked is ſnared in the work of his own hands;</hi> when the Lord takes men, and burns them like Bees in their own Hive: truly that is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument God is up; men could not do that: God brings mens waies eminently upon their own heads: you have a Scripture very remarkable, <hi>Micah</hi> 4.

That is a ſecond ground, how we may know whether God ariſe for his people.</p>
                  <p>In the third place; when the Lord takes away the hearts of his enemies; truly, my Brethren, the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of Spirits is not in men, but in <hi>the Father of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;</hi> when it ſhall be truly ſaid, <hi>the men of might have not found their hands</hi> when that ſhall befall them that the Lord threatneth in <hi>Nahum</hi> 3.17. <hi>their Captains ſhall be like the great Graſs hoppers in a Sunny day:</hi> the Sun ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth and they are gone; when <hi>their ſtrong holds ſhall be like ripe figgs falling into the mouthes of the Eaters;</hi> when God ſhall make the very names of men terrible to the enemies, certainly God hath the Diſcipline of Spirits: when it ſhall be ſaid, <hi>the ſword of the Lord, and the ſword of Gideon;</hi> and that as it is ſaid, <hi>a Barley Cake ſhall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Tent, this is the Lords doings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Certainly, God doth ariſe, In the fourth place, when the Lord acteth the Spirits of his people unto high, and noble and invincible reſolutions; draws them out to reſolutions more then men; when he guides their ſtrength, when he girds up their ſpirits to the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s: in <hi>Zach.</hi> 4 6. <hi>Not by power, nor by might, but by my Spirit:</hi> how did the Spirit of God do it? truly, it is the Spirit of God working in the hearts of men, raiſing up their hearts to encounter with the greateſt difficulties, to look a thouſand deaths in the face with boldneſs, and elevating the ſpirits of men beyond what or linarily is in men, this is the Lord, the Lord riſeth when it is ſo.</p>
                  <pb n="375" facs="tcp:115739:215"/>
                  <p>And then in the laſt place, when the Lord goes on in waies of mercy, and draws out his loving kindneſs, ſometimes the Lord may ſtep forth for his people; and he may withdraw himſelf again, and then the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings of their hearts will be ready to ſay, it is the Lord is upon us: but when the Lord holds on a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual tenor of mercies, when it ſhall be ſaid as it was to <hi>Ioſhua there is no man ſhall ſtand before thee all the daies of thy life, I am with thee:</hi> Is it ſo my Brethren? then all men muſt conclude, ſurely <hi>the Lord is raiſed up out of his holy habitation:</hi> And this is the firſt point.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond I ſhall ſpeak a little to, but very briefly, that I may come to the ſecond general in the Text: I am loth to treſpaſs, or to ſtraighten him that ſucceeds in the ſervice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The ſecond Doctrine that I propounded to you was this, <note place="margin">Dostrine.</note>

No, that is not the meaning of it: but this; he gave it to be food to their faith, not to their bodies; for their faith to

If he ſounds the firſt Trumpet againſt</hi> Rome <hi>Chriſtian, he goes on to the ſeventh.</hi> So having begun to pour out ſome <hi>of the Vials againſt Antichriſtian</hi> Rome, ſurely the Lord will never leave till the laſt vial be poured out. So it is a great encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to the Saints, the great experiments they have had of the Lords riſing for them in his providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial actings, that the Lord certainly will go on.</p>

                  <p>In the firſt place, the Apoſtle <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.27. tels us, <hi>that the Lord doth ſhake the things that are made, that the things that cannot be ſhaken may remain:</hi> he ſhaketh the things that are made, that they may be removed, that the things that cannot be ſhaken may remain: then the end why the Lord hath ſhaken in Church and State whatſoever is of man, what the Lord will not have to continue, it is that he may remove it. Why now this is the great end then that the Lord hath, <hi>that things that cannot be ſhaken ſhould remain:</hi> Whatſoever Jeſus Chriſt hath removed, all the power of men ſhall never exalt: for he did ſhake it to that very end, <hi>that he might remove it:</hi> I ſay, what the Lord hath removed, as a thing made moveable, all the powers of men ſhall never be able to eſtabliſh again. Jeſus Chriſt will maintain the ground he hath won. That is the firſt Argument. Yea,</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond place: when <hi>Chriſt rides forth for to Conquer,</hi> he conquers not at once, but <hi>he will go on to conquer:</hi> that is another argument: you may ſee him
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:115739:219"/> going forth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.1,2. <hi>he rideth forth conquering and to conquer:</hi> he did not conquer all at once, but he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries on the victory. <hi>Luther</hi> (I remember) ſaid when he began, <note place="margin">Luther.</note> 
                     <hi>brevi efficiam ut Anathema ſit eſſe Papiſtam:</hi> it ſhall not be long ſaith he, but by the grace of Chriſt I ſhall bring it about that it ſhall be looked upon as a curſed thing to be a Papiſt: God hath carried on the work ſtill; and I remember it was the ſpeech of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer</hi> one of our Martyrs when he came to be burnt, <hi>I hope I ſhall kindle a fire this day in</hi> England <hi>ſhall never be put out; Romanum nomen de terra tolletur:</hi> Certainly, the Lord Chriſt will carry on his work for he conquers not all at once, <hi>he goes on conquering, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the third place: Conſider I beſeech you, <hi>the ten Kingdoms ſhall deſtroy the whore:</hi> that is my third argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: the ten Kingdoms are the Inſtruments God will uſe. Antichriſt riſeth in a double beaſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. in his civil power; ſo he makes up one beaſt with the ten Kingdoms. In his Eccleſiaſtical he makes up his ten Kingdoms in the Clergy: that is <hi>the Beaſt that hath two horns like a Lamb: he ſpeaks like a Dragon.</hi> Now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve I beſeech you; theſe ten Kingdoms the Lord will make uſe of to deſtroy the Whore: therefore he muſt reſerve a conſiderable party: Nay, a major party, <hi>that ſhall hate the Whore:</hi> who ſhall become <hi>choſen, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful:</hi> the Lord hath been pleaſed to make this one of the ten Kingdoms: certainly the Lord will uphold a major party here: <hi>thoſe that ſhall keep themſelves, that be Virgins, not defile themſelves with the fornications of Antichriſt:</hi> and the Lord will raiſe them up for this great ſervice: and <hi>they ſhall ſtand with the Lamb upon Mount Sion.</hi> Conſider I beſeech you this: and then
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:115739:219"/> when you look about upon thoſe glorious providential acts of God for you, truly, you may comfort your ſelves with this, <hi>the Lord is raiſed up out of his holy ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation:</hi> he hath begun, and he will carry on the work. And ſo much now for the firſt branch of the Text; the Propoſition: <hi>the Lord is raiſed up out of his holy ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation.</hi> The inference that followeth upon it, I ſhall ſpeak but briefly to: only I pray you lend me your dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ear, and with that I ſhall conclude. I would be loth to treſpaſs in reſpect of time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Lord is raiſed up out of his holy habitation:</hi> what then? <hi>be ſilent Oh all fleſh before him.</hi> That is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference: <hi>be ſilent O all fleſh before the Lord.</hi> Theſe words Interpretets referr both to the Churches enemies, and to the people of God who were returned from the Land of their captivity. The particle, <hi>Interjectio eſt ſilenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um Imperans,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Jerom.</note> 
                     <hi>Ierom.</hi> Oh, that is here uſed, is a kind of Interjection by which the Lord commandeth ſilence, and not a ſilence of the tongue only, but ſilence of the ſoul: <hi>My ſoul keep ſilence unto God:</hi> There is a double ſilence in the world.</p>
                  <p>Some men keep ſilence in policy, becauſe they would not diſcover themſelves till a convenient time. But all the people of God that will approve themſelves, they muſt keep ſilence in duty: Well,</p>
                  <p>Firſt then: Let us look upon enemies, and as it is a direction to them, a command laid upon them, <hi>Oh all fleſh be ſilent before the Lord.</hi> I here is a double ground of all ungodly mens ſilence; and I find it uſed ſo in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, there is a ſilence from ſhame, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.19. <hi>let the lying lips be put to ſilence, that cruelly and deſpightful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeak againſt the righteous;</hi> ſilencing may be by ſhame.</p>
                  <pb n="380" facs="tcp:115739:220"/>
                  <p>Secondly, there is a ſilencing of men wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h fear, and aſtoniſhment, <hi>Pſal</hi> 107.41. <hi>he ſetteth the poor on high with Princes; the righteous ſhall ſee this and rejoyce, and all wickedneſs ſhall ſtop their mouth;</hi> men ſhall be amazed to ſee it. There is a ſilence from ſhame, there is a ſilence from fear: then it is as if ſo be the Lord ſhould have ſaid, unto all the Churchs enemies, for ſhame, or if not for ſhame, for fear ſuppreſs your murmurings; away with your boaſtings, your cenſurings, your ſlanderings. <hi>Keep ſilence Oh all fleſh before the Lord;</hi> why now, give me leave to inforce it a little. All thoſe that are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies unto Gods actings among his people, give me leave to ſpeak a word to you, if any ſuch are here, as in moſt of our Congregations it is like there are.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>the Lord is raiſed up out of his holy habitation,</hi> doth gloriouſly appear in providential actings for his people, then ſee that you <hi>keep ſilence;</hi> I ſay, away with your murmurings, your diſputings, your cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, your ſlanderings; and let me inforce it upon theſe four grounds; remember them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt know, the Lord hears all your murmurings; the Lord takes notice of all your cenſurings; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times men in deſign keep ſilence, becauſe they dare not ſpeak out; But remember what the Lord told his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple when they murmured againſt <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 16. the Lord tells them, that they have not murmured againſt thee, at the 7. <hi>ver. they have not murmured againſt thee, but they have murmured againſt me.</hi> When God appears in Inſtruments, and you evidently ſee the hand of God with them: then, when you murmur at theſe Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, you murmur againſt God: remember that, and the Lord takes notice.</p>
                  <pb n="381" facs="tcp:115739:220"/>
                  <p>In the ſecond place: It is a far greater Judgement for a man to be given over to a froward fretful ſpirit under an affliction, then any affliction that can befall him: I deſire that it may ſink deep into all your hearts: I ſay, to be given over under an affliction, to a froward, and a fretful ſpirit, is a greater judgement then any affliction can befall him: for a man to be <hi>like a wild Bull in a Net, full of the fury of the Lord;</hi> the croſs he cannot bear, and yet he cannot avoid it. I intreat you conſider, it is worſe then any other judgement can befall you; it is the Devils ſin, and it is the Devils puniſhment: mark this I ſay, it is the Devils ſin, and it is the Devils pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment: the Lord croſſeth him in all his deſigns, and yet notwithſtanding for all that, ſtill his ſpirit riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth up againſt all his acting: and ſo, envy is his ſin, and his plague: now do you mark; it is true all ſins are from the Devil, but yet ſome are from him <hi>per modum ſervitutis:</hi> others <hi>per modum Imagini:</hi> in ſome ſins you do the Devils work, but in ſome ſins you bear the Devils image: and I beſeech you conſider: this is the condition of every man, ſo far as he is given over to a froward, fretful, perverſe, diſcontented ſpirit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the providential actings of God towards his people: Conſider I beſeech you, it is this that makes Hell: this makes Hell, when a man is under the hand of God, that yet he cannot bear it, nor he cannot avoid it. It was a good ſpeech of <hi>Bernard,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Bernard.</note> 
                     <hi>Ubi non eſt propria vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntas, non erit infernum:</hi> take away a mans ſelf-will, and truly you take away hell: this is that my Brethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren makes it be ſo: when an affliction lies upon a man, all that while his will continually riſeth againſt the dealings of God, and he frets againſt the hand of God upon him, it is the greateſt Judgement could befal him.</p>
                  <pb n="382" facs="tcp:115739:221"/>
                  <p>In the third place: This will certainly hinder your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. It is a ſad Scripture that, &amp; ſo much the more ſad, becauſe it hath an aſpect upon the times in which we live, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.9. you read of <hi>the Vial poured out upon the Sun:</hi> the higheſt authority in Church and State: ſo far as it holds to <hi>Rome.</hi> Now the Text ſaith, that <hi>men ſhould be ſcorched;</hi> the ſame Vial that was poured out upon the Sun: I ſay now, that men ſhould be ſcorched, exceedingly fretful, perplexed in ſpirit: and what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows? why, the text ſaith, <hi>they blaſphemed God that had power over theſe plagues, and they repented not to give God the glory.</hi> My Brethren, there is not a greater Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment befalls men in theſe daies, then through a fretful ſpirit againſt the inſtrument, to neglect the hand of God, and not repent and turn.</p>
                  <p>Yea, in the laſt place: that I may draw to wards a concluſion: This will provoke the Lord (I aſſure you) for to bring greater plagues upon you: therefore take heed to it, to keep ſilence before him when you ſee Gods hand upon you, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.11. <hi>When the hand of the Lord is lifted up, they will not ſee, but they ſhall ſee, and be aſhamed,</hi> for their envy at the people, ſaith the Text. My Brethren, God worketh Judgements in leſſer cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters at firſt; and truly if men cannot read it, he will write them in more eminent and capital Letters: ſmall judgements, they will not open wicked mens eyes: tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, neither will they ſtop wicked mens mouthes; and if they will not do ſo, aſſuredly God will have a way for all wicked men to ſtop their mouthes: therefore if you would not have Judgements encreaſed take heed when you ſee the Lord appearing for his Church providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially acting, the Lord is up then; Say to thy own ſoul, <hi>Let all fleſh be ſilent before him:</hi> That is the firſt: look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:115739:221"/> upon theſe words as referring to the Churches enemies.</p>
                  <p>A word I ſhall add, looking upon theſe words as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring to the poor diſtreſſed Jews who were now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned out of the Land of their Captivity; but there was a mighty power of the enemy againſt them: why yet ſaith the Lord, do you keep ſilence: ſilence your doubtings, ſilence your frettings.</p>
                  <p>Silence your doubtings. It it ſaid of <hi>Abraham, Rom.</hi> 4.20. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                     <hi>he did not diſpute the buſineſs, pro</hi> and <hi>con;</hi> and truly, neither muſt you; if God be up, leave the work in his hand: leave off your doubtings, leave off your doubtings upon conjectures and ſuppoſitions. That is the firſt: <hi>Let all fleſh keep ſilence;</hi> ſilence your doubtings</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Let all fleſh keep ſilence:</hi> ſilence your frettings: ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 39. <hi>I kept ſilence, I was dumb</hi> ſaith he, <hi>for it was thy doings.</hi> A terrible Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment befell <hi>Aaron;</hi> two ſons were taken away by an immediate ſtroke from Gods hand, and <hi>Aaron held his peace:</hi> his ſpirit did not riſe, and diſcontentedly fret at the preſent diſpenſation; Oh, ye that fear God, take heed, when the Lord ariſeth for his people; <hi>keep ſilence before him:</hi> ſilence your doubtings, ſilence your fret tings. That I preſs by four conſiderations, and ſo I ſhall conclude; I beſeech you mark them You that fear God, that know his name, that expect an intereſt in all that mercy that the Lord intendeth for his people in the latter daies, take heed I ſay, that ye keep ſilence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Conſider but this: <hi>will you contend with God? will you I ſay, contend with God in Judgement?</hi> the Lord challengeth that; <hi>Who will appoint me a time? who will
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:115739:222"/> contend with me in Iudgement?</hi> Will you diſpute the buſineſs out with God? Conſider, Gods Judgement is the laſt Judgement: and his Judgement is an eternal Judgement: from his Sentence there is no appeal: it is the worſt courſe that a man could take, that is to be Judged, to undertake to contend with his Judgement before God: therefore take heed of it you cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with God in Judgement, <hi>Iob</hi> 9.32.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>In the third place, conſider this, A fretful ſpirit, even in Gods own people, doth ſtrangely blind their eyes that they cannot ſee the goodneſs of God in the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but take many times that which is a high and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious mercy, they take it to be a croſs and an afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: My Brethren obſerve, envy will ſtrangely hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wink a man: <hi>when the hand of the Lord is lifted up, they will not ſee:</hi> why? for their envy at the people, they text ſaith; it is an evil frame of ſpirit in a Chriſtian; a froward, diſcontented, fretful ſpirit, a ſpirit ill becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Saint: your wiſdom ſhould hinder it: <hi>Solomon</hi> tels

                     <hi>frigidus ſpiritu,</hi> he is a man <hi>of a cool ſpirit,</hi> a man of underſtanding: a great many men will ſpeak of their underſtandings, and their zeal many times: but know, that <hi>a man of underſtanding is of a cool ſpirit.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, the Spirit of Chriſt comes in the form of a Dove; be innocent as Doves, without gall, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  <p>In the laſt place, and ſo I have done: Conſider, <hi>doth the wrath of, man work the righteouſneſs of God?</hi> the Apoſtle S. <hi>Iames</hi> tels you clearly the contrary: certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, you that will maintain Gods cauſe, you muſt do it by Gods means; the Lord needs no carnal weapons, no help of any body, no fleſhly intereſt to maintain his ſpiritual cauſe; no: I entreat you conſider it: when if ever you will carry on the cauſe of God, let it be done by the means, and with that ſpirit that God requireth. I dare undertake you ſhall find that of <hi>Nazianzen</hi> a good rule, <note place="margin">Nazian.</note> Let us be weak, that we may overcome; I, that is the way, the way to overcome men, or to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage a cauſe, though you ſay it is the cauſe of God: I ſay it is not to be done by humane heats, and fleſhly animoſities; therefore this is that I ſhall leave with you for the preſent, in theſe five conſiderations farther, and
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:115739:223"/> ſo have done. Firſt, God hath never ſet up any autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or way of government, but he hath reſerved to himſelf in his providence a power to change it at his pleaſure, <hi>Zach.</hi> 21.10. <hi>Remove the Diadem, take away the Crown:</hi> God will ſhew himſelf to <hi>be King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</hi> Secondly, it is his ordinance that there ſhould be a Magiſtracie; they are called <hi>the ſhields of the earth: the ſtay of your tribes; the foundations of the earth:</hi> and it is not good there ſhould be an Anarchie: for <hi>God hath ſet Rulers over men:</hi> ſome by providence, ſome by promiſe. But yet God ſets them over them: that ſhould be enough to reſtrain men of giddy ſpirits, who are like <hi>the children of Belial,</hi> without a yoak: therefore let us not go about to <hi>pluck up our own bedge, and deſtroy our own foundations, Hab.</hi> 1.13.

But be content to ſubmit to the bounds that God hath ſet you. Thirdly, though this Government be an Ordinance of God: yet the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and ſpecification of it is but an humane creation, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

Fifthly, in all difficult caſes it is beſt to go the ſafeſt way, that a whole Nation periſh not through their own wilfulneſs: I ſhall add no more. When the Lord riſeth, <hi>when the

In this Chapter you have the Lord returning unto his own people in mercy. There is a double viſitation of God: One of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in wrath; the other of his people in mercy. His enemies in wrath, in the former verſe before the Text. <hi>I was angry with the Shepherds, and I did puniſh the Goats;</hi> it is ſpoken of thoſe former tyrannical Governors that ruled over them; ſometimes called <hi>Shepherds,</hi> in the 11. Chap. ver. 5. <hi>their poſſeſſors ſlay them, and hold not themſelves guilty; and their own Shepherds pitty them not.</hi> Sometimes ſtiled <hi>Goats:</hi> oppreſſing Governors are commonly ſo called in the Scripture, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 14.9. <hi>All the Rulers of the earth:</hi> it is the ſame word in the Original, all the <hi>Goats</hi> of the earth: for Goats feed high: they are of all creatures moſt luſtful: and yet amongſt the creatures very unuſeful: <hi>nec ad bellum proſunt, nec ad aratrum:</hi> a fit reſemblance of Oppreſſors. This was the Lords viſitation now of his enemies in wrath.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he viſiteth his people in mercy: and though the appearances of God in this viſitation were glorious: for he was mightily ſeen in their deliverance: yet he makes themſelves to be the inſtruments to effect it: God doth it, but he doth it by themſelves: <hi>I will make Iudah as a goodly horſe in the battle:</hi> the excellency of the horſe is in the battle, <hi>Iob</hi> 39.21. he meets, <hi>he goes forth to meet the armed man: he doth mock at fear, and he turneth not back from the ſword, for thou haſt clothed his neck with thunder;</hi> ſuch a goodly horſe now doth the
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:115739:225"/> Lord make his own people to be in the battle: it is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary in Scripture for God to reſemble his people to all ſorts of war-like inſtruments, <hi>Zach.</hi> 9.13. <hi>I will bend</hi> Judah <hi>for me: and fill the bow with</hi> Ephraim: <hi>Iudah</hi> is the bow, <hi>Ephraim</hi> the arrows: as there they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled to a bow in the battle, ſo here they are Gods charging horſes, they are my goodly horſes. It is true indeed, the Lord is the rider, the motions of theſe horſes are ordered by him: and when the victory is, now it is not the horſe wins, it is not the horſe conquers, but the rider: yet notwithſtanding they are my goodly horſes for the battle. Thus you ſee the Viſitation of God. Firſt, of his enemies in diſpleaſure. Secondly, of his people in mercy.</p>

               <p>Firſt, the corner-ſtone laid in the foundation, <hi>aedifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um ſuſtinet,</hi> it upholds the building: the main weight of the building lies in the corner-ſtone: ſo you ſhall find it uſed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.16. <hi>behold I will lay in Sion a precious Corner-ſtone;</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Out of him ſhall come forth the Nail:</hi> What is that? It is a Metaphor uſed likewiſe for Governors. You have that clear place in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 23.23,25. there is the removing of one bad Governor and the ſetting up of a good: <hi>Shebnah</hi> is removed: <hi>Eliakim</hi> is exalted: the Lord ſaith of them both, they are a Nail faſtned in a ſure place. <hi>A Nail faſtned in a ſure place ſhall be removed,</hi> ſaith the Lord, ſpeaking of the diſplacing of <hi>Shebnah;</hi> and <hi>I will faſten him as a Nail in a ſure place,</hi> ſpeaking of the exalting of <hi>Elikaim.</hi> There is a double Analogy, or propoſition in that Metaphor.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Clavibus connectuntur, &amp; compinguntur inter ſe trabes:</hi> the beams of the building are faſtned, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Nails one to another: ſo that the Corner-ſtone doth not only unite the foundation: but the Nails they unite the roof.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>vaſa ſuſpenſa pendent;</hi> upon the Nails all the Veſſels hang, that is the Metaphor uſed there; <hi>I will faſten him as a Nail in a ſure place; and you ſhall hang upon him all the glory of his Fathers houſe;</hi> the off-ſpring, and the iſſue; all the Veſſels, even from cups to flag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons; all the neceſſary Utenſils of the houſe, they all hang upon this Nail: ſo then the meaning is this; That out of <hi>Iudah</hi> ſhall come forth a Magiſtrate, who ſhall be as a corner-ſtone to ſupport; to unite; to adorn the Common-wealth of Iſrael. And he ſhall be as a Nail; he ſhall be for union above, as well as a Corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone below; and upon him all the building of the Common-wealth ſhall hang, even from the higheſt to the loweſt; <hi>all ſorts of Veſſels, even from flaggons to cups.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Out of him ſhall come forth the Battle Bow;</hi>
                  <pb n="394" facs="tcp:115739:227"/> the Bow was an Inſtrument of war, much in uſe in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient times, and therefore is here put for all the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of war all their ammunition for and all their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of war: now the Lord had ſaid before, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1.5. <hi>I will break the bow of Iſrael:</hi> and then there ſhould be no ſucceſs in any of their undertakings there ſhould not be any inſtrument of war, nor any ſucceſs in the uſe of them; and ſo that <hi>Zach.</hi> 9.10. its ſaid, <hi>the Battle-Bow ſhould be cut off from Ieruſalem;</hi> whereas formerly they had no ſtrength for war, but fell before their enemies continually, and were given to them as a prey; it was the Lord had broken the battle-Bow, and therefore they did hire in the neighbour Nations for to be their ſtrength; and <hi>ſometimes they are found in the way of</hi> Egypt, <hi>ſometimes of</hi> Aſſyria; but when the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns unto them in mercy for their deliverance, they ſhould have ſtrength of their own againſt all the neighbour Nations; ſo that <hi>out of themſelves ſhould come forth the Battle-Bow:</hi> and they ſhould be ſucceſsful in war, and <hi>tread down their enemies as mire in the ſtreets;</hi> becauſe the Lord is with them: So, that when the Lord did return to them in mercy, he would give them power for, and ſucceſs in war alſo.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Out of him every Oppreſſor, or Exactor, which I put both together, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="395" facs="tcp:115739:227"/> but doth alſo put the enemies into their power, ſo that they rule over them: for, that is the promiſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 14.2. <hi>They ſhall take them for ſervants and for hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maids;</hi> they ſhall take them Captive, whoſe Captives they were: and they ſhall rule over their Oppreſſors, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.5,6. <hi>The Rulers of the Gentiles ſhall come unto thee: the Dromedaries of</hi> Midian, <hi>and the gold of</hi> Sheb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah: <hi>They ſhall bring Gold and Incenſe.

Bellum ſaepe renovabit Antichriſtus, &amp; ſaepe vincet, donec conſectis omnibus Impiis, debellatus:</hi> it is he hath drawn in all the wicked of the earth in his quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel: But that is now the work of the Lord that he is doing, making preparation for that great and laſt battle, <hi>the battle Armageddon:</hi> and you will find a confederacy of all thoſe of the Popiſh Intereſt, and <hi>that have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the mark, either in the right hand or in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head:</hi> and they ſhall ſome on one account, and ſome on another be engaged, that they may periſh together:
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:115739:228"/> and, <hi>then the Kingdoms and Dominions under the whole earth, ſhall be given to the Saints of the moſt high:</hi> But that is not until the fourth Beaſt be deſtroyed: <hi>The God of heaven ſhall ſet up a Kingdom by it ſelf,</hi> and after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the fourth monarchy: and therefore that which now doth hinder the ſetting up the Kingdom of God in the world, ſhall be deſtroyed with an utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. This I conceive to be the meaning of the words.</p>
               <p>You have then in theſe words the ſtate of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſet forth after their deliverance, what it ſhall be, and that is double.</p>
               <p>Look upon them firſt <hi>in ſtatu Politico:</hi> and afterwards <hi>in ſtatu Polemico.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, in reference to their Politick ſtate: ſo (ſaith the Lord) they ſhall never want a Governor, a (faithful Magiſtrate: but he ſhall be to them <hi>as the Corner, and as the Nail:</hi> their enemies ſhall rule over them no more, <hi>the Scepter ſhall no more depart from</hi> Judah: they ſhall have thoſe of their own that ſhall be able to uphold the Government, and unite the Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, look upon them <hi>in ſtatu Polemico:</hi> ſo he ſaith: <hi>Out of him ſhall go forth the Battle-Bow:</hi> they ſhall have all ſotts of war-like proviſions in themſelves: and they ſhall be very ſucceſsful in war: they ſhall tread down their enemies, and they ſhall rule over their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors. Theſe are the promiſes that the Lord makes of a glorious eſtate unto his people after their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. But it is the firſt only that I am to ſpeak to, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only proper for the preſent occaſion: <hi>Out of him ſhall come forth the corner.</hi>

                  <p>The Obſervation that I ſhall deliver to you from thence is this; <hi>When the Lord returns to his people in
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:115739:228"/> mercy, he will give unto them Governors that ſhall ſupport them: that ſhall be for the ſupporting, for the uniting, and for the adorning of the Common wealth:</hi> I ſay, when the Lord returns to a people in mercy, he will give unto them Governors that ſhall be for the ſupport, the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and adorning of the Common-wealth. Here are but two things that the time will give me leave to ſpeak to; Therefore I ſhall omit the third.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall ſhew you, that when the Lord returns to a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in mercy, he gives them ſuch Governors as ſupport the Common-wealth; they ſhall be as the Corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone upon which the weight of the building may lie.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he doth give them ſuch Governors as ſhall be as the Corner ſtone, that may unite the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall begin with the firſt. Firſt, good Magiſtrates are as the Corner-ſtone to ſupport the Common-wealth; it is true, all the ſtones in the building do conduce to the upholding thereof; for as it is in the ſpiritual build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo it is in the Politick, <hi>men are built as living ſtones;</hi> but I ſay, the main weight of it lies upon the Corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, becauſe the weight of the building, the burden of all lies upon the Magiſtrate; therefore I ſay, he is here reſembled to a Corner-ſtone. Now, that a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates buſineſs is to uphold the Common-wealth, take notice of theſe four denominations in the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Magiſtrates are called the foundations of the earth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82.5. and <hi>Mich.</hi> 6.2. where he ſpeaks of the oppreſſion of Magiſtrates, he ſaith, <hi>all the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the earth are out of courſe: I have ſaid yee are Gods:</hi> why? you that are the foundations of the earth: to pull up Magiſtracy, is to pluck up all by the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Secondly they are called the breath of your Noſtrils, <hi>Lam.</hi> 4.20. <hi>the breath of our Noſtrils:</hi> it is ſpoken of <hi>Zedekiah</hi> who was an evil Prince, yet he hath this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable title given him by the Prophet: it is as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for a man to live without breath, as it is for a Common-wealth to ſubſiſt without Magiſtracy.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they are called <hi>the ſhoulders</hi> upon which all the weight is born, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22. <hi>I will give him the key of the houſe of David: I will lay the key of the houſe of David upon his ſhoulders:</hi> a key is <hi>Symbolum poteſtatis,</hi> an emblem of Government: Now ſaith the Lord, I will not put the key in his hand, but I will lay it upon his ſhoulders, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Unto us a child is born; the Government is upon his ſhoulder: Principes mundani onus gubernandi reji<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <note place="margin">Luther.</note> ſaith <hi>Luther:</hi> there was but one ſubject in a City, and that is the Magiſtrate: the weight of all yes upon him And it muſt needs be ſo if you take his reaſon: for he ſaith, <hi>Ante peccatum Politia nulla fuit, politia eſt remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um neceſſarium naturae corruptae:</hi> all civil Government was but a neceſſary remedy, that was brought in for cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature: Now if it be a remedy againſt corrupt nature, the burdens of corrupt nature are exceeding many: in ſo much as the Lord himſelf complains in

                     <hi>Amos</hi> 2.13. <hi>I am preſſed under your abominations as a Cart that is full of Sheaves:</hi> therefore I ſay, the weight of all, the ſupporting of all lies upon the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy, they are the corner-ſtone upon whom the weight of the building lies.</p>
                  <p>But the great enquiry will be: how are Magiſtrates the corner-ſtone of the Common-wealth? how do they, or how muſt they ſupport the Common-wealth, that their duty may anſwer their dignity? that they may indeed prove <hi>corner-ſtones?</hi> I ſhall give you five directions as briefly as I may.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that the Magiſtrate may be a corner-ſtone to ſupport the building: he muſt take care that he uphold Religion: that muſt be his firſt, that muſt be his great care; that which ſhould be mainly in our eye in praying for them, ſhould be chiefly in their eye in practiſing, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Pray for Kings, and thoſe that are in Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that you may lead a peaceable, and a quiet life in godlineſs and honeſty;</hi> peace without godlineſs, is but a vain, and a mock-peace: but becauſe now this is made a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, I ſhal offer three conſiderations, which truly are to me unanſwerable, that the Magiſtrate is to take care of Religion: Nay, his great care, his firſt care is to be of that: pray obſerve them well, becauſe you are every where told now, <hi>Magiſtrates have nothing to do with mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the firſt place; every Magiſtrate ought to rule with God, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 11. ver. <hi>ult. Judah rules with God;</hi> the throne of the Magiſtrate is therefore called, <hi>the throne of God.</hi> When <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was exalted to the ſeat of the Empire; it is ſaid, <hi>he was taken up into the throne of God, Rev.</hi> 12.5. then the great care of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates muſt be, that they do not rule alone: but that
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:115739:230"/> they have God to rule with them: it is true, <hi>the moſt high rules in the Kingdoms of mortal men, Dan.</hi> 4.17. but he rules but as he doth rule in the Kingdom of the Devils; he rules but by a way of providence; but you that fear God, ſhould endeavour that God ſhould rule among you as he rules among his Saints, in waies of grace; in waies of grace I ſay: Now I beſeech you conſider; let Religion be neglected or corrupted, preſently God forſakes that people. Look but into the 10. and 11. Chapters of the propheſie of <hi>Ezekiel;</hi> it is true, the Lord doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all at once: <hi>but the glory of the Lord goes up firſt from the Cherubims to the threſhold of the houſe, from the threſhold of the houſe to the midſt of the City, and from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>he City to the Mountains;</hi> my Brethren, if the glory of God leave your Ordinances once, be well aſſured, he will leave your City next; the next move is that: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whatſover you do, if you would rule with God, take heed that by this means he be not provoked to depart; for a Magiſtrate ruling alone, and a Miniſter preaching alone is much alike: the one will never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert a ſoul: and truly the other will never ſubdue a people: Nay mark what the Lord ſaith; to convert ſouls, and to ſubdue hearts is his work. <hi>David</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.47. <hi>Thou art he that ſubdueth the people under me,</hi> ſaith he; <hi>truly if a man in his perſon neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect Religion, he lives without God in the world; and if a Magiſtrate in his Government neglects Religion, he rules without God in the world.</hi> That is the firſt argument: and I never expect to have it anſwered, I look upon it as an unanſwerable conſideration.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is this, and pray mark it, for you had need endeavour to ſtrengthen your thoughts againſt
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:115739:230"/> ſuch deluſions as theſe are, that are everywhere ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted: I wiſh it were not in men in high places. In the ſecond place. A Magiſtrate ought ſo to rule, as that God may not break in, in Judgement upon a people: Pray mark it: you ought to rule ſo, as God may rule with you. Secondly, you ought ſo to rule as that God may not in Judgement break in upon the people: my beloved, you that are Magiſtrates, you are <hi>the ſhields of the earth,</hi> called ſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 47. <hi>ult.</hi> the ſhields of the earth: Now conſider, I humbly pray you: a Shield is a defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive weapon, that the main protection of the people lies in: you are not only to protect them from injuries among men, but you are to protect them alſo from Judgements from God: and therefore when wrath goes out from the Lord, <hi>Moſes ſtands in the gap;</hi> when <hi>a plague is gone forth from the Lord,</hi> David <hi>intercedeth:</hi> Hezekiah <hi>prayes for the people:</hi> the Magiſtrate is to be a Shield to them. But let the Magiſtrate in his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment neglect Religion: what then? the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God breaks in upon the people immediatly: look into <hi>Ezek.</hi> 10.2. <hi>Go, ſaith the Lord, take fire from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Cherubims, &amp; ſcatter over the City:</hi> here is a fire now to burn the City; whence comes it? out of what? Ordinances neglected; the fire is taken from between the Cherubims, it is taken from off the Incenſe Altar: it will not only ſerve to offer the ſacrifices, but the ſame fire will ſerve to burn the City too; that is a Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture that I deſire you much to obſerve, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.19,20. <hi>If you forſake my ſtatutes, and ſerve other Gods,</hi> ſaith he; be negligent in matters of Religion once: and what then? <hi>ſaith the Lord, I will pluck you up by the roots out of the Land that I have given you:</hi> there be ſome men now that think to root you by the neglect
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:115739:231"/> of godlineſs, and to root you by the neglect of Religion; this it not the way to eſtabliſh you: no, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, this is the way to pluck you up by the roots, even your Common-wealth before it hath ſcarce taken root.</p>
                  <p>In the third place, I beſeech you conſider: Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates ought ſo to rule as they deſtroy not the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their authority. You will ſay he is a fooliſh man that puls down his own houſe with his own hands: then certainly Magiſtrates muſt ſo rule as that they deſtroy not the foundations of their own Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. My Beloved, if you uphold not Religion, you do ſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.5. <hi>you muſt be ſubject,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>not only for fear of wrath, but for conſcience ſake:</hi> why all Divines give this as a rule, <hi>conſcientia immediate Deo tantum ſubſicitur:</hi> Conſcience is ſubjected immediately to God only: then we are to obey the Magiſtrates, only becauſe it is an Ordinance of God: can any man rationally imagine, that men will obey the Magiſtrate for conſcience ſake, who is an Ordinance of God, and to be obeyed immediately, that neglects this Ordinance of God in which this authority immediately is; can any man rationally imagine, I ſay, that men will obey the Magiſtrate for God, that do not obey God for himſelf? my Beloved, this is the way to deſtroy, and to pluck up by the roots, I ſay, all authority: it deſtroies the foundation of all authority: it is the moſt deſtructive opinion to Government that ever came into the world: and yet notwithſtanding, it is obſervable too, ſee how the Jeſuites and ſome others meet in this thing, though upon different grounds: <hi>Mariana</hi> he ſaith, <note place="margin">Mariana.</note> 
                     <hi>Princeps ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil ſtatuat de Religione;</hi> Princes and Magiſtrates have nothing to do with matters of Religion, ſaith he: why? becauſe there he would eſtabliſh the authority
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:115739:231"/> of the Pope: now ſay ſome others; the Magiſtrate he hath nothing to do in matters of Religion, becauſe though he will cry out againſt the Pope, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he will make himſelf one, he will take ſuch a licentiouſneſs, that he will take to himſelf the Papal authority: thus I intreate you then to Conſider: this is the firſt thing wherein the Magiſtrate ſhould ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the corner indeed, to ſupport the Common-wealth, let him uphold Religion. That is the firſt. I ſhall be more brief in the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Magiſtrate is to be the corner to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Common-wealth, in upholding the Laws: <hi>the Laws are the foundations of the earth;</hi> they be ſo called, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 11.3. <hi>if the foundations be caſt down, what can the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous do?</hi> the Laws are the foundations; it is a note of ignominie ſet upon Oppreſſors, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.25. that <hi>they</hi> labour to <hi>change times and Laws:</hi> they labour to change the times and Laws: the Law is the Rule between the Subject and the Magiſtrate, that the one may know how to rule, and the other know how to obey: it is the ſtandard between a man and his neighbour, by which all differences are to be tryed: therefore they that are in ſupreme authority, they ought to take ſpecial care to obſerve the Laws: and they that are in ſubordinate au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, they ought to take ſpecial care to execute the Laws; for this cauſe Magiſtrates they ought to be well acquainted, make it their buſineſs to ſtudy the Laws by which they are to rule; the truth is, my Beloved, a Magiſtrate without the Law, and a Miniſter without the Bible, they are equal abſurdities: a Magiſtrate unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the Law, and a Miniſter ignorant in the Scripture. <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>I was an eye to the blind, and feet to the lame, and a father to the poor; I diligently ſearched out the cauſe,
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:115739:232"/> ſaith he, Job</hi> 29.15: I diligently ſearched out the cauſe; it may be he had more ſenſe to complain, then he had skill to explain; but <hi>I ſearched it out ſaith he;</hi> he that ſhall do ſo, muſt be skilled in the Laws; there are in waies of ſin many cunning conveyances. <hi>David</hi> tells us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58.2. that <hi>there are men that weigh violence in the earth; that weigh violence, that commit ſin by meaſure;</hi> they know how far they may go, and yet how far they incurr danger; by this means an unskilful Magiſtrate many times <hi>juſtifies the guilty, and condemneth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent:</hi> therefore its your duty I ſay, to preſerve the Laws: it is your duty to be well skilled in thoſe Laws; this is certain, an ignorant Miniſtery wrongeth many a ſoul, and an ignorant Magiſtracy undoeth many a cauſe; Therefore that is the ſecond. It would be very honourable unto the Governors of this honourable and populous City that they would apply themſelves much theſe waies, that they may know the rules of their own judgements, and not be acted barely by thoſe that plead the cauſe; God will judge by Law my Brethren, when he comes to judge; and ſo ſhould you; <hi>he will judge the ſecrets of all men according to my Goſpel;</hi> he will not judge by prerogative, he will judge by Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16. That is the ſecond; uphold the Laws, and you uphold the Common-wealth.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Magiſtrates are to uphold their own autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and in ſo doing they uphold the Common-wealth: I ſay, you are to uphold your own authority: to what purpoſe is the Legiſlative power, if there be not an exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive power? the Magiſtrate is to be <hi>the living Law;</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. If once the authority of God fall in the heart of a man, the authority of his Law will quickly fall down: So if once the authority of the Magiſtracy
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:115739:232"/> fall before men, truly the authority of the Law exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by it will quickly come to nothing: therefore it ſhould be your buſineſs to uphold your own authority. In <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.8. it is ſaid, <hi>that a wiſe Ruler ſcattereth the wicked with his eye.</hi> It is the Magiſtrates duty to uphold their authority in the higheſt, <hi>to ſcatter the wicked with their eyes.</hi> There is a generation of men that are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to authority, and they talk of Levelling all every day: I deſire that you would be pleaſed to conſider, ſupport your authority in the execution of Laws; for if you cannot do that, if you cannot ſupport your own authority, you will hardly be able to ſupport the Law, which is in it ſelf <hi>a dead letter:</hi> true indeed, it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the men of <hi>Belial</hi> ſhould be willing to be <hi>ſine jugo,</hi> without <hi>a yoak.</hi> It is ſaid, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. <hi>there were Sons of Belial that brought him no preſents;</hi> it is no wonder I ſay: for conſider ſeriouſly, this is that which comes to paſs ſometimes by the Sons of men, and ſometimes by the juſt Judgement of God. <hi>Zach.</hi> 11 <hi>ult.</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>the ſword ſhall be upon the right hand of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate;</hi> his ruling power ſhall be taken away, he ſhall have no authority, his authority ſhall come to nothing, the ſword ſhall be upon his right hand: my Beloved, if the Lord engage your hearts to uphold holineſs among you, there is nothing will ſtrike that awe into the hearts of offenders, of the proudeſt oppreſſors, as that will, when Magiſtrates bear a double image, the image of God in them as men, and the image of God upon them as Magiſtrates. Uphold your authority; that is the third.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the Magiſtrate is to uphold the peoples liberty, and in ſo doing he upholds the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: uphold the peoples liberties: the liberties
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:115739:233"/> among the <hi>Romans,</hi> were looked upon as ſacred things, and of very high eſteem, <hi>Acts</hi> 22.28 <hi>with a great price bought I this freedom: but I was free-born, ſaith Paul:</hi> your liberties my Beloved, have coſt much more then his could coſt: what expence both of treaſure and blood? and therefore how great care, what great care ſhould the Magiſtrate take? thoſe that are <hi>Cuſtodes li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertatis:</hi> it is your honours to be Keepers of the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of your City: it is your honour; <hi>aliud eſt obedire, aliud ſervire:</hi> it is one thing to obey as a ſubject, it is another thing to ſerve as a ſlave: therefore I ſay, the liberty of the people, that in an eſpecial manner ſhould be preſerved; you muſt draw them with the cords of a man, drawn from Law and Love: or otherwiſe, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he be that thinks to ride a people as a Beaſt, that Beaſt will with the firſt opportunity caſt his rider: and this is the true reaſon why ſo <hi>many ſtars have fallen from heaven;</hi> this is the true reaſon why you ſee at this very day ſo many <hi>Princes walking like ſervants upon the earth;</hi> for ſurely that Authority which entrenches on the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples liberty, is not laſting; <hi>nullum violentum eſt perpetuum;</hi> its the liberty of the people that equal Juſtice be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all, and that all have equal acceſs to it: and that it be adminiſtred <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, without reſpect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or to ſervants, or friends: do not put a difference in the caſe, out of partiality to any man: for all men ſhould have the ſame intereſt in the Magiſtrate as a Magiſtrate: and all particular reſpects in Judgements ſhould be put far away: the moſt upright and wary Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates may ſometimes diſtribute unevenly: for the Ballances do ſeldom hang even, when ſome perſonal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects are put into one end: Conſider that I beſeech you. That is the fourth particular.</p>
                  <pb n="407" facs="tcp:115739:233"/>
                  <p>In the laſt place, and ſo I have done with this firſt Branch, (I am ſorry the time haſtneth ſo.) The Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate muſt uphold the propriety of the people, and in ſo doing he upholds the Common-wealth: he muſt uphold their propriety, <hi>that every man may ſit down un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his own Vine, and under his own figg tree, Mica</hi> 4.4. That men may have ſomething that they may call their own: not only their own in reference to the Subjects, but their own in reference to the Magiſtrate: for we are to conſider, <hi>univerſa ſunt in Regis imperio, non in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonio;</hi> though you come under the Magiſtrates com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, yet all is not the Magiſtrates patrimony; he may not diſpoſe of the ſubjects eſtates at his pleaſure: it is a dangerous thing when Magiſtrates prove <hi>Nimrods, mighty Hunters before God,</hi> when they hunt many for the eſtates of the people: it was a ſad complaint, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>why haſt thou made men like fiſhes of the Sea that have no Ruler?</hi> where the great ones ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure the leſs without controul. Theſe are ſad com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints when they come up before God: this is that that hath buried many a State in its own aſhes, that the propriety of the people hath not been preſerved; for <hi>Auguſtine</hi> complains of old, <note place="margin">Auguſt.</note> that <hi>mundi regna,</hi> what were they ſaith he, <hi>ſed magna latrocinia,</hi> the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the world what be they? why truly, but great Robberies. Now I humbly deſire you to conſider: then is the Nation, then is a Common-wealth ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, then do Magiſtrates prove the Corner, when the Liberties, when the Religion, I ſay, the Law, the Authorities, the Liberties, the Proprieties of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are preſerved: and remember the promiſe: and we may look out for the time, in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 45.8. <hi>My Princes</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>ſhall oppreſs my people no more: my Princes they ſhall
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:115739:234"/> give unto their people their portion in my Land:</hi> ſaith he, they ſhall not take all to themſelves, but they ſhall be contented with their own portion: &amp; they ſhal be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented that their Brethren ſhall take their portion; My Princes ſhal oppreſs my people no more: Now, my Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, then ſhal you that are Magiſtrates prove the corner-ſtone to a Nation, or to a Common wealth, or to a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>y, when you do thus uphold them. And that is the firſt thing: The Corner-ſtone, <hi>aedificium ſuſtinet;</hi> it upholds the building.</p>
                  <p>I would ſpeak ſomething of the ſecond, the Corner-ſtone <hi>aedificium continet,</hi> it unites it: Magiſtrates are not only to ſuſtain, and to uphold, but they are to unite: Magiſtrates be called <hi>Healers, Iſa.</hi> 3.7. they muſt bind up the wounds of the people. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt, it is his glory and work, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>he doth unite them all under one Head: things in Heaven and things in earth, Eph.</hi> 2.20,21. <hi>in Adamo nos omnes uni ſumus, Proſp.</hi> that as in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo it is true in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam,</hi> it is in him they are made one and united: The Corner ſtone is to unite as well as to ſupport.</p>
                  <p>Oh, But you will ſay to me: It is union that we all long for: we are a divided people; ſhall we alwaies <hi>eat the fleſh of our own arms? ſhall</hi> Ephraim <hi>be againſt</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſeh, <hi>and</hi> Manaſſeh <hi>againſt</hi> Ephraim, <hi>and both againſt</hi> Judah <hi>ſtill? The ſtaff of bonds is broken</hi> amongſt us: ſhall it alwaies remain broken? what way is there that there might be a healing in this, that this breach might be made up?</p>
                  <p>Why truly, the hand of the Ruler muſt be firſt in this thing, that the mercy may be called by his name, the hand of the Ruler muſt be firſt in it: you that are the Corner ſtones muſt unite the building: you talk of
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:115739:234"/> perſwading the people to unite; I ſay the hand of the Ruler muſt be firſt in the union.</p>
                  <p>I, but you will ſay: how can that be?</p>
                  <p>I beſeech you, let me give you a few directions, and then I ſhall from all make a ſhort Application, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude. The waies of union are theſe five: and I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you that are in Authority to lay them to heart.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place: Religion is the great bond of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: therefore I ſay, let it be your great care that there be a unity in Religion; the greateſt breach is in that, <hi>Odia-religionum ſunt accrbiſsima:</hi> no breach like that. You ſhall ſee what began a breach between <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah:</hi> it was Religion upon a Politick reſpect, <hi>when God rent the Kingdom from the houſe of</hi> Rehoboam; but obſerve, the Politick difference might have been made up, and <hi>Jeroboam</hi> out of his Deviliſh ſubtilty foreſaw it, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12.17. he ſaith, <hi>if the people go up to Jeruſalem to worſhip, their hearts will turn again to the houſe of</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, ſaith he. The Politick difference would have been made up: therefore ſaith he, <hi>I will make them two Calves, one in</hi> Dan, <hi>and the other in</hi> Bethel; and this ſhall ſet them at a perpetual diſtance: the difference, the Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick difference might have been made up, the State dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; but the difference in Religion would never: therefore this was the way to divide them perpetually. If ever you will unite the people, there muſt be your foundation: So the Lord begins when he will unite his people, <hi>Zach.</hi> 14.9. <hi>Iehovah ſhall be one, and his name one:</hi> you ſhall have but one God, and you ſhall worſhip him one way, by one name: Now you have many Gods, and many names: <hi>Ichovah</hi> ſhall be one and his name one, <hi>Ier.</hi> 32.39. <hi>I will give them one
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:115739:235"/> heart, and one way;</hi> one way: in what one way? in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that is the main thing he ſpeaks of: or as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.9. <hi>They ſhall ſerve the Lord with one ſhoulder.</hi> I deſire therefore, that no man would take delight in keeping up differences in matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; take heed of it, either upon this ground, becauſe you look upon it as policy to uphold parties, or elſe it may be, becauſe you dare not diſpleaſe either party: take heed of it I ſay; <hi>be valiant for the truth upon earth:</hi> in this, <hi>contend earneſtly for the faith once given to the Saints:</hi> uſually a girdle was an ornament belonging to the Magiſtrates in former times: it is fit for thoſe that are Rulers to wear it ſtill: <hi>have your loins girt about with truth, Eph.</hi> 6.14. Beloved, it is true, I expect not that all men ſhall be of one mind, one judgement. I know men ſee with different light: and I know, <hi>that while the ſmoke of the Temple laſteth,</hi> as it ſhall be during the pouring out of the Vials, <hi>Rev</hi> 15. <hi>I know the Sea of glaſs will be mingled with fire:</hi> but in this you ſhould be of one mind: you muſt be in <hi>the fundamentals,</hi> that without which there can be no Religion, no Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; he that ſpeaketh againſt theſe, openeth his mouth wide againſt Heaven.

                  <p>Secondly, if Magiſtrates would unite the people, then take heed: agree amongſt your ſelves, if you would have union amongſt the people; I ſay, agree amongſt your ſelves: if the Corner-ſtones once fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder, you may eaſily expect many cracks in the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: differences amongſt Governors muſt needs cauſe ſtrange diſtractions among the people, for they are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally led by parties and perſonal reſpects: therefore if you would heal this breach now which you all ſeem to complain of, begin with your ſelves, <hi>Phyſitian heal thy ſelf:</hi> heal your own differences firſt, all diviſions amongſt your ſelves; this is the way the Lord takes in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1. <hi>ult.</hi> he ſaith, <hi>they ſhall appoint to themſelves one Head:</hi> they ſhould have many Governors united all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, they ſhould be all under one head: I beſeech you conſider it: how comes it to paſs then, Governors in their Politick meetings meet with as great confuſion, as they did in their Church, Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical meetings, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.26. <hi>how is it</hi> (ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) <hi>that every one hath a Pſalm, and every one a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and every one hath a Revelation, and every one hath an Interpretation: let all be done to edifying:</hi> every man did ſeek to ſhew his gifts, and to lay out his own parts, without all reſpect to the edification of the Church: So many times it proveth in Politick meetings too.

<pb n="412" facs="tcp:115739:236"/> to Chriſtians; <hi>My Brethren be not many maſters,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, in <hi>Iam.</hi> 3.1. When a maſterleſs diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on bears ſway in Rulers, truly then if their pathes in every thing be not trodden, they are ſo far from being Counſellors, that they are themſelves uncounſellable. My deſire therefore to you is this; that ſuch Breaches amongſt your ſelves may be made up, that amongſt you there may be none ſuch, if it may be. But I ſhould further deſire, that if any ſuch be, you would with more wiſdom keep them amongſt your ſelves then you do: if ſuch differences and breaches, whatſoever they be amongſt you in counſels, come abroad, they cauſe great diviſions amongſt the people, and great animoſities in the hearts of the people, ſome one way, and ſome another, as their party, or their fancy leadeth them.</p>
                  <p>In the third place labour for union amongſt the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters; that ſhould be one thing that the Magiſtrate ſhould take ſpecial care for: endeavour a union among the Miniſters of the Goſpel: they will have ſtill, and God would have them have a great influence upon the people. If there <hi>be jarrs between</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Barnabas, it is no wonder then, if <hi>one be for</hi> Paul, <hi>and another for</hi> Apollo: people preſently fall to parties: therefore I deſire you to conſider, in a ſpecial manner, let it be your care that the Miniſters be united: far be it that they ſhould be men to ſtir up ſtrife: and that they ſhould cauſe diviſions, or nouriſh them amongſt the people: ſurely, it is your duty, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.19 to <hi>follow after the things that make for peace;</hi> and thoſe <hi>that will edifie one another.</hi> It is an obſervation that <hi>Bullinger</hi> hath, <note place="margin">Bullinger.</note> I remember in a Tract that he hath written <hi>de perſecutionibus Chriſtianae Eccleſiae,</hi> be ſaith: that whenſoever the Church had
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:115739:236"/> peace, <hi>auctae ſunt diſſentiones praecipue inter Epiſcopos &amp; Doctores quibus populus nihil aedificabatur:</hi> by and by there aroſe differences amongſt the Miniſters, and by this means the people were not edified but deſtracted: and what then? then the Lord gave them to ſuch a perſecution, and then to ſuch a perſecution, <hi>ad abſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendam aeruginem:</hi> and thoſe of us now that cannot pray together, nor give thanks together; no, by no means, we can neither pray for the ſame mercy, nor give thanks for the ſame deliverances: truly then we may go together in the ſame priſon, and it may be die at the ſame ſtake; far be it therefore from the Miniſter of the Goſpel, I ſay, that they ſhould cauſe diviſion or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it: but if ſuch a thing be, it was <hi>Nazianzens</hi> laſt requeſt to the Emperour before he left the Court, <note place="margin">Nazianz.</note> that he would uſe all the Authority he had to reconcile the Miniſters, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                     </gap>, Cauſe that diſſention, cauſe that war to ceaſe.</p>
                  <p>Oh, But you will ſay, how is it poſſible we ſhould do it, how can it be?</p>
                  <p>Truly, the Apoſtle hath a Rule, if it were we I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, and as well practiſed, would reach very far in it: you have it in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.32. <hi>the Spirit of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets is ſubject to the Prophets:</hi> the Spirit of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets is ſubject to the Prophets: the Spirit of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, that is, the Doctrine which they did profeſs to ſpeak by the Spirit, this Doctrine is ſubject to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; how? <hi>prophetarum cenſuris,</hi> to their examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to their cenſure; they were to try it by the rule of the word, whether it were the word of God or no; Now, if the Spirit of the Prophets be ſubject to the Prophets, then certainly if men were to undergo ſuch a tryal of Doctrine, they would not be ſo ventrous both
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:115739:237"/> in the Preſs and in the Pulpit, as now every where they are; but it is for want of this rule not being obſerved, the ſpirit of the Prophets is ſubject to the Prophets. That is the third direction. Reconcile the Miniſters, and you will unite the Nation.</p>
                  <p>In the fourth place. I will but add a word of the reſt. Take away all oppreſſion, and all partiality in judgement; there will never be a union till then; while there is oppreſſion there will be diviſion: it is a ſure rule; <hi>Ubi deſinit judicium, ibi incipit bellum;</hi> war begins where judgement ends: a ſure rule; hold the reins of Government with an even hand: I ſay do not hold them ſtrait upon ſome, and looſe off upon others: for if you do, there will be <hi>a heart-diviſion that will ariſe:</hi> take but that Scripture (but mark) it is a notable Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, <hi>Job</hi> 34.17. <hi>Shall be that hateth right Govern?</hi> ſaith he: the word is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> ſhall he that hateth right bind up? ſo it is in the Original, ſhall he that hateth right bind up? truly that man that doth not adminiſter judgement righteouſly in his Government, that man will never bind up the breaches of a Nation: he that hateth right will never bind up the ſore.</p>
                  <p>In the laſt place: pray for this mercy, you that are Magiſtrates, pray for it: it is not only your duty to rule the people, but to pray for them. <hi>Hezekiah prayed for the people;</hi> and you find upon every occaſion, <hi>Moſes his hands were up:</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaith, <hi>God forbid I ſhould ceaſe to pray for you,</hi> ſaith he. And God hath promiſed to hear the prayers of the Magiſtrates in an eſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; you pray <hi>ex oſficio;</hi> you pray as men in office: their prayers are more then the prayers of any private and particular man, if they be godly. Conſider, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beſeech you: as it is in Church-Officers, <hi>Iames</hi> 5.14,
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:115739:237"/> 15. ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>If any man be ſick, let him ſend for the Elders of the Church, and let them pray over him:</hi> why not for the Brethren as well as for the Elders? The Lord hath ſpecial reſpect to men in office: and in an eſpecial manner let your prayers be by ſtrength of arguments of faith drawn from thoſe great promiſes, <hi>I will give them one heart, and one way: the two ſticks ſhall become one in my hand:</hi> and by this means the Lord may make you <hi>the healers of the breach: the Corner-ſtone to unite,</hi> as well as to <hi>uphold the people.</hi> This is the dignity and this is the duty of Magiſtrates, that as Corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones they uphold the building; and that as Corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones they unite the building.</p>

                  <p>I, but you will ſay, What manner of perſons muſt they be, what manner of men muſt they be now that will be fit for this great work?</p>
                  <p>Truly, I ſhall but make choice barely of that dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction laid clearly down, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18.21. the common rule for Magiſtrates which I ſhall briefly offer to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and conclude. They were to chooſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors under <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe he could not bear the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple alone: now ſaith he, <hi>chuſe you able men, fearing God; men of truth, hating covetouſneſs:</hi> mark ye: Firſt, I ſay, make choice of <hi>men fearing God;</hi> have not reſpect to riches ſo much, or to ſeniority ſo much, where there is not piety: Let that be the great thing you have in your eye: For I beſeech you conſider, they that have not <hi>given themſelves unto God,</hi> they will never govern for God; they will never give up themſelves to the publick good, who have not in that great work of Regeneration denyed themſelves; they can never do it: and therefore I ſay, it is the greateſt wrong you could do ſuch a man to chuſe him to an eminent place: for what do you do? You do but put into his hands a far greater occaſion, an opportunity of ſinning. Beſides (I beſeech you conſider) if they have not the fear of of God in their hearts, they will not have the preſence of God in their Government: I ſay, if they have not the fear of God in their hearts, they will not have the preſence of God in their Government: and ſurely they will never rule well, that rule without God: in ſtead of being a Corner to ſupport the Common-wealth, truly they will be a means to deſtroy it. Therefore that is the firſt thing; have reſpect unto godlineſs; let them be men fearing God; thoſe that have firſt given themſelves to God,
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:115739:238"/> and then when they have given themſelves to Gods ſervice, they will give themſelves to yours: but never elſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The ſecond direction that is there given, is, they muſt be <hi>men of courage; able men,</hi> you read it; it is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in the Original, it ſignifies ſtrength either of body or mind; they muſt be men of ſtout and reſolute Spirits. Magiſtrates meet many times with matters of great difficulty: ſometimes they be ill looked upon by them that are above them: ſometimes they are ill ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of by them that are below them. Now I ſay, this will require a ſtoutneſs, and reſolution of ſpirit, that a man ſhall not flatter the one, nor he ſhall not ſtrive to pleaſe the other, but go on in his duty, and not turn aſide neither to the right nor to the left hand. I told you, Magiſtrates are called <hi>the Shields of the earth;</hi> a Shield is a venterous weapon, receiveth all the Darts: and I ſay he had need be a ſtout-ſpirited man that muſt undertake ſuch an employment: he muſt be a man of courage, that he may not for fear of them above him, nor that he may pleaſe them below him, he may not ſtep by, or beyond his duty. He may diſpiſe the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs of the multitude, and he ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Seneca.</hi> It is the property indeed of a noble Spirit: for if you ſhould chuſe now a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted man, one that is not able to encounter with difficulties, but is afraid of the appearance of every danger, when any oppoſition preſents it ſelf, his heart faileth, and he will be ready to turn with every wind; you have ſeen woful experience thereof: therefore I ſay, the next thing, as to be <hi>a man fearing God,</hi> ſo in the next place, let him be <hi>a man of courage,</hi> a man of ſtrength and reſolution of Spirit.</p>
                  <pb n="418" facs="tcp:115739:239"/>
                  <p>In the third place; let him be <hi>a man of truth:</hi> chuſe men of truth: that is, not only men that love the truthes of God, <hi>and are valiant for the truth upon earth</hi> in that reſpect, but men that love truth in judgement: men that love <hi>to execute true judgement,</hi> as the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is. My Beloved, a falſe Judgement is a lye to Authority, and therefore the greater tranſgreſſion: I ſay a wrong Judgement is a lye to Authority, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the greater tranſgreſſion: there is a great deal of Art not only in ſinning, but in concealing, <hi>Micah</hi> 7.3. <hi>So they wrap it up;</hi> ſometimes the forgery of a witneſs; ſometimes the ſubtilty of a pleader, there is a miſt caſt before the eye of the Magiſtrate: and truly by this means many times wrong judgement proceedeth from him: which now if he be not a man that loves truth, he will never be diligent to ſearch out the cauſe; and therefore that is the third thing: Chuſe <hi>men of Truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then in the laſt place, Let them be <hi>men hating covetouſneſs:</hi> hating covetouſneſs; not only he muſt not be a covetous man, but muſt be a man that hateth covetouſneſs: Certainly my Beloved, <hi>that man that is greedy of gain, will tranſgreſs for a morſel of bread;</hi> the pooreſt circumſtances will turn this man out of the way of Judgement; <hi>a gift blindeth the eyes, Deut.</hi> 16.19. truly, the man cannot ſee with his own eyes, he cannot ſee with the eyes of the Law, nor he cannot pronounce the Sentence of the Law: ſurely men will never take care for the publike profit, ſo long as their eyes are ſet upon their own private gain; it was an old obſervation of <hi>Salvian:</hi>

Therefore in an eſpecial manner theſe are the directions I give you, and I lay it upon your conſciences <hi>in the name of the Lord,</hi> that you make choice of ſuch a one, and that will ſerve for thoſe high and glorious ends that hath been mentioned to us, <hi>to ſupport and to unite the building:</hi> by this means (my Beloved) the Lord ſhall be with them, and with you in their Government: and by this means, <hi>your City ſhall be called a City of righteouſneſs, a faithful City.</hi> And ſo much now ſhall ſerve for the opening to you this firſt branch of the Text, how <hi>to ſupport, and unite.</hi> Let us look up to God for a bleſſing.</p>

But I ſhall paſs theſe by, and pitch only on thoſe things which the Apoſtle doth in theſe words mainly intend: which is to preſs them to perfect ſanctification, having promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes made unto them of the great perfection: the Doctrine which we ſhall therefore ſpeak is this.</p>

                  <p>As perfect holineſs hereafter ſhall be the Chriſtians Crown, ſo ſtriving to perfection here is the Chriſtians duty: <hi>perfecting holineſs in the fear of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here I will ſhew you two things. Firſt, what holineſs is: Secondly, what perfection of holineſs is, and ſo come to prove this point. Firſt, to begin with the firſt: What holineſs is? The holineſs of God being abſolute and independent as all his other Excellencies are, cannot as I conceive conſiſt in relation, but muſt be an abſolute and poſitive thing: which I conceive to be nothing elſe but the purity of the divine nature: but now holineſs in the creature being a dependent excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, having its principle from another, and its pattern in another, that is in God, and in the Law: it muſt conſiſt in conformity unto another, as the truth and goodneſs of the creature doth: ſo that the holineſs of the creature is nothing elſe but a conformity of the
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:115739:242"/> creature unto the purity of God, manifeſted in his Law. I do not ſay the holineſs of God as in himſelf, but the holineſs of God as in the Law: in conformity whereto the holineſs of the creature doth conſiſt. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fall, the holineſs required was only poſitive, conſiſting in a conformity to the duty commanded: but ſince ſin, there muſt be a cleanſing from the ſins forbid: it was before only a conformity to the precept, but ſince it is a conformity to the holineſs of God in the prohibition alſo: ſo that as in the Juſtification of a ſinner, there is more required then was required to juſtifie the Angels, or <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency; not only a doing the duty, but a ſuffering the curſe: ſo in the ſanctification of a ſinner alſo, there is more required to make us holy, then there was to make <hi>Adam</hi> holy: It is not now barely a <hi>creation of the new man;</hi> but alſo a <hi>mortification of the old,</hi> and a deſtroying of the <hi>body of ſin;</hi> not only ſanctification and dedication to what is holy, but a purification and ſeparation from what is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean: therefore here the Apoſtle ſets down both parts of holineſs; purification and dedication, <hi>a cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a mans ſelf from all filthyneſs, and then a perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing holineſs in the fear of God.</hi> Secondly, the perfection of holineſs therefore conſiſts in three things. 1. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectio gradus;</hi> when corruption is perfectly cleanſed, and all filthineſs, and in all degrees, and in all faculties, both of the fleſh and of the ſpirit. 2. <hi>Perfectio eſſentin:</hi> when grace hath attained its full pitch unto which it is appointed; <hi>the meaſure of the age of the ſtature of Chriſts fulneſs to all might</hi> in every grace and every faculty. 3. <hi>Perfectio operationis:</hi> when thoſe perfect graces have their perfect works as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>James</hi> 1.4. <hi>Let patience have its perfect work;</hi> that you may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:115739:243"/> and entire, wanting nothing: ſo that the point hath in it thoſe three branches.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, perfect purification, which ſhall be hereafter our glory is in this life our duty: in that every one that is <hi>an heir of the promiſe, is to purge himſelf from all filthyneſs:</hi> and this perfection of purification conſiſts in three particulars. Firſt, in being purged from all kinds of ſin, all filthineſs, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Mortifie therefore your members which are upon the earth fornication, uncleanneſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Now the luſts of the fleſh, the luſts of the eye, or the pride of life,</hi> can be diſpenced with; neither ſins of ignorance, or ſins of knowlede; ſins of omiſſion, or ſins of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; neither in thought, word or deed: nay it ſhall riſe ſo high, that a man ſhould ſtrive not only that ſin might not riſe, but that ſin might not be; anſwerable to that prayer of the Apoſtle, <hi>I pray God that you do no evil,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.7. When a mans labour in purging holds correſpondency with the purity of the Law: and is of equal latitude: <hi>thy Law ſaith</hi> David, <hi>is very pure, thy Commandment is exceeding broad, Pſal.</hi> 19.40. <hi>&amp; v.</hi> 96. when a man hath an inward principle of purity anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the exact purity of the Law, and as broad as the Law, that a man <hi>hates every falſe way: I was alſo upright before him, and I kept my ſelf from mine iniquity: becauſe it is the ſtumbling block of their iniquity, Pſal.</hi> 19.28. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.23. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7.19. Secondly, from all degrees of thoſe kinds of ſin: ſo to be cleanſed, <hi>as that he may be preſented not having ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing, but that he may be holy and without blemiſh, Eph.</hi> 5.26,27. when a man doth ſtrive, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                  <head>Reaſons.</head>
                  <p>Now the reaſons of the point, to mention ſome of many that might be brought.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe of the filthyneſs and ſpreading na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of all ſin. 1. Becauſe of its filthy nature, <hi>it is an open Sepulchre, and the ſtink thereof, Rom.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.11. it is <hi>aſcum,</hi> it is <hi>a vomit.</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20. <hi>it is dung:</hi> Nay to expreſs it to the higheſt, it is, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>the very excrements of naughtineſs;</hi> ſo that if there could be any thing worſe and more filthy then naughtineſs it ſelf, that is ſin: <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Wherefore lay apart all fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyneſs and ſuperfluity of naughtineſs,</hi> &amp;c. What ever is loathſom in the world, it is all too little to give names to ſin: and if ſin be ſo in it ſelf, if filthyneſs in its eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, then all the parts of it is filthyneſs: and though there be but the remainders of ſin in the godly, yet this is their nature; for every ſpark is of the ſame nature with the ſire: and every drop with the water, becauſe it is <hi>corpus homogeneum,</hi> ſo is the body of ſin alſo. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, and it is not more filthy then it is ſpreading: therefore it <hi>is rottenneſs, Iſa.</hi> 1.6. <hi>from the ſole of the foot to the head, there is no ſoundneſs in it;</hi> it is <hi>a leproſie, a gangrene,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.8. it is <hi>the plague:</hi> the moſt infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious diſeaſe, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.38. <hi>it is a poiſon, Rom.</hi> 3.13. and therefore ſo long as any remains, ſo long there will be a continual infection: if a man hath but one luſt in his ſoul, this will ſpeedily conceive and bring forth all ſin: for the birth of ſin is monſtrous, it will not only bring forth luſts after its kind, but luſts of divers, nay of a contrary kind, <hi>covetouſneſs is the root of all evil,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.10. if there were but that one luſt in the ſoul, all ſins
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:115739:244"/> would grow out of it, even its contrary corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Becauſe Chriſt hath perfectly bought off all ſin, in every kind and degree, and he is as well a <hi>fountain for the filthineſs of ſin to waſh it, Zach.</hi> 13.1. as <hi>a Sea</hi> for the guilt of ſin to drown it, <hi>Mich.</hi> 7.19. And to this end, <hi>he gave himſelf that thou mighteſt be without ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing, Eph.</hi> 5.25,27. And ſhould not a man ſtrive to have all the price out of the blood of Chriſt? conſider the perfect cleanſing was the price of blood: it is a great undervaluing of the blood of Chriſt, and not the leaſt pitch of propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, not to ſeek after that which our high Prieſt hath purchaſed at ſo dear a rate; ſhould it not grieve man to ſee luſt poſſeſſing that which he ſo dearly bought? <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius has ſegetes?</hi> Nay let the Spirit of Chriſt come and take a full poſſeſſion of what he hath purchaſed. I might mention divers other reaſons which will be brought in to the anſwering of this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Objection.</label> This is to put men upon ſeeking impoſſibilities, which was never promiſed, never attained, but as we know in part, and propheſie in part, ſo our grace is but in part, and our purification in a meaſure: <hi>Who can ſay, I have made my heart clean? I am pure from my ſin?</hi> Nay the beſt men have thoſe ſores running upon them, and therefore have need of the <hi>balm of Gilead:</hi> the beſt are <hi>clad with filthy Garments:</hi> and need that the Lord ſhould ſay, <hi>Take away the filthy Garments, and I will cloath you with change of rayment, as in</hi> Zach. 3.4,5.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Anſwer.</label> Firſt, perfect purity is commanded both in nature and life: the Law condemns each uncleanneſs with a curſe
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:115739:245"/> 
                     <hi>To him that continues not in all things, Gal.</hi> 3.10. <hi>which are written in the book of the Law to do them;</hi> neither did Chriſt come to aboliſh the Law; but a juſtified perſon is as ſtrictly bound to the Law for duty as <hi>Adam</hi> was, though not with ſuch evil conſequences: he is bound under danger of contracting ſin, though not under danger of concurring death: he that came to redeem men from ſin, did never come to priviledge men to commit ſin: he that <hi>was made a curſe for ſin,</hi> never came to be a cloak for ſin: therefore, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Chriſt ſaith, not a title of the Law ſhall paſs.</hi> One obſerves, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion notes <hi>Abſolutiſsimum legis complementum:</hi> the Jews ſuperſtitiouſly conceived, that there were ſtrange myſteries in every point and prick in the letter of the Law: Chriſt ſaith, I am ſo far from deſtroying the Law in regard of duty, that if the ſmalleſt letter, and the leaſt tittle of the Law had ſuch hidden myſteries in it as you teach and conceit, yet every ſuch title, and the myſteries therein ſhall be fulfilled and perfectly accompliſhed: for this perfect purity we had in <hi>Adam, Eccl.</hi> 7.29. <hi>God made man upright, but he ſought out many inventions;</hi> our inability to obey, doth not take away Gods authority to command: and therefore he requires not the ſame <hi>duty</hi> only, but the ſame <hi>power. Luk.</hi> 10.27. <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy might:</hi> that is not, thou ſhalt love him with all the ſtrength thou haſt: and thou ſhalt reſiſt ſin withal the ſtrength thou haſt: but with all the ſtrength that I have given thee, and which thou waſt to have: ſo that the ability comes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the commandment, as well as the duty; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore want of ability to reſiſt ſin perfectly, is both thy ſin and thy puniſhment. Secondly, Becauſe God hath commanded abſolute perfection, to be perfectly freed
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:115739:245"/> from ſin: therefore the godly have prayed for it: Chriſt taught them ſo to do, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.13. <hi>And deliver us from evil.</hi> And <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.7. <hi>I pray God that you do no evil. Heb.</hi> 13.21. <hi>The God of peace make you perfect in every good work to do his will; the God of peace ſanctifie you throughout; and I pray God that your whole ſpirit, ſoul and body, may be kept blameleſs,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.23. for I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that the whole will of God is the ground of prayer, <hi>if we ask any thing according to his will, he hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us,</hi> Joh. 5.14. therefore the precept is as well as the promiſe; only the precept requires perfection, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the rule of obedience required under the firſt Covenant, though not made ſubſervient to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond: but the promiſe is not of perfection here, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it anſwers only to the grace which the Lord in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to beſtow in the ſecond Covenant. I know that theſe prayers of the Saints were never fulfilled here, but the beſt men have departed hence have ſouls im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, much wanting of this purification: perfection is reſerved for time to come, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.23. <hi>And to the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect,</hi> that is only in heaven: yet ſuch prayers and endeavours be not vain, and all ſuch ſtrivings after perfection is not to no purpoſe. Firſt, becauſe here a man manifeſts his diſpleaſure againſt ſin, and his love to the Commandment: and though he hath brought upon himſelf a miſerable neceſsity of ſinning, yet notwithſtanding the evil that he doth he hates, and therefore cryes out, <hi>Oh miſerable man: Who ſhall deliver me from this body of death? Rom.</hi> 7.15.24. Secondly, hereby a man manifeſteth the abundant ſincerity of his heart towards the Lord Chriſt: That he would not only not have ſin to raign, but alſo that it ſhould not be; that not only his waies,
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:115739:246"/> but his nature alſo ſhould be conformable to the Law in all things: and not only that Chriſt ſhould rule, but alſo that he ſhould rule in him without reſiſtance and controul: he would not have the Kingdom of Chriſt amongſt his enemies here, but over his enemies: that <hi>every thing might be brought into ſubjection,</hi> 2 Cor. 10.5. <hi>That he might tread every enemy under foot,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.25. Thirdly, hereby a man doth his duty in ſtriving to perfection, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Work out your ſalvation Phil.</hi> 2.12. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>rem rudem &amp; informem expolire:</hi> and ſo by doing his duty he makes his heart perfect with the Law, even in the imperfection of his obedience: for the Lord accepts the will for the deed: the duty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to us, the ſucceſs to God: and he takes it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding kindly that men ſhould be willing, not only to, but, beyond their power, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.3. <hi>Abraham</hi> did his duty in praying for <hi>Iſmael,</hi> and the Lord did graciouſly manifeſt the acceptance of his perſon and prayer, when he did deny the particular requeſt he asked of him. Fourthly, Though ſuch prayers and endeavours be not anſwered in perfection, yet they ſhall be anſwered in degrees; and if God add but a further degree, it is not loſt; for Gods uſual manner is to make one mercy to his people an anſwer to a former prayer, and an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to beg a further mercy: and it is not in vain if God in any degree <hi>give a man his hearts deſire, and do not deny him the requeſt of his lips, Pſal.</hi> 22.2,3. for as formerly Propheſies were truly fulfilled, though by degrees: ſo prayers and endeavors are truly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, though but by degrees, yet ſo as ſtill an anſwer in a degree is a ſure pledge that God will in his due time fulfil all our petitions. Fifthly, thoſe prayers and endeavours are not loſt, which are for things not to be
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:115739:246"/> accompliſhed in this life: for as Chriſts righteouſneſs <hi>is an everlaſting righteouſneſs,</hi> becauſe it <hi>is offered unto God by an eternal Spirit, Heb.</hi> 9.14. ſo I conceive the prayers of the Saints being ſacrifices unto God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they be offered with publick intentions, and by a publick and eternal ſpirit, are eternally accepted, and of an everlaſting efficacy, though after a mans death to be accompliſhed in this world, or in that which is to come. <hi>David</hi> puts up a prayer by the ſpirit againſt <hi>Judas, Pſal.</hi> 69.8,9. and it took effect upon him many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years after he was dead, and had ſeen corruption. God hath promiſed to <hi>bring forth Judgement to victory, and to preſent you without ſpot or wrinkle:</hi> your prayers and endeavours; for this ſhall add to your glory: and theſe promiſes ſhall be accompliſhed in the Lords time: and then your names ſhall be recorded in thoſe mercies, as thoſe that were co-workers with God, and preparing your own glory here for hereafter: and then you ſhall rejoyce in them not only as Gods mercies, but alſo as an anſwer to your prayers: all the prayers of the godly are not for preſent fruit, yet ſo as they bring a harveſt many years after; and then when it comes, a man hath the ſweetneſs of the mercy, and the anſwer of the prayer, all come in together: if the Spirit that indites prayers doth ſo here in this life, how will it do hereafter when he ſhall dwell in a man for ever without grievance? how will a mans joy be great, when his joy ſhall be as the joy of harveſt? oh how full will a mans joy be then!</p>

                  <p>Let it therefore ſtir us up to the practiſe of this duty, which is here exhorted, and that is <hi>perfect cleanſing:</hi> And now to awaken us to it the more, I will give ſome
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:115739:247"/> Rules by which men may judge, that they have great need of this exhortation, and that the work of cleanſing is very imperfect in them: Conſider theſe ſix particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To ſin much againſt knowledge, is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a very unclean ſpirit, whether it be againſt principles, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. <hi>ult. Who knowing the Iudgement of God, that they which commit ſuch things are worthy of death, not only do the ſame, but have pleaſure in them that do them:</hi> or againſt repeated admonitions, as <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> did: or againſt the ſecret inſtructions of a mans own conſcience, <hi>the chaſtiſement of his reins,</hi> as <hi>Darius</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> did againſt <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, <hi>Mark.</hi> 6.22. or againſt truths profeſſed, as <hi>Saul</hi> againſt Witches: and truths glorified in us; the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Thou art called a Iew, and makeſt thy boaſt of God, and glorieſt in the Law; through breaking the Law diſhonoureſt thou God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The more ſpeedily luſt takes away the man, the more unclean that man is; therefore the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is, <hi>A man ſoon angry,</hi> Prov. 14 17. <hi>A man of a haſty ſpirit, Eccl.</hi> 7.9. but on the other ſide, <hi>a man of underſtanding,</hi> that is, a holy mortified man, <hi>is of a cold ſpirit:</hi> ſo that though the fire of corruption blown long by Satan may kindle at laſt, yet it doth not ſpeedily, becauſe he hath a cold ſpirit, not a Gun-powder diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition unto evil, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.22. as ſoon as the harlot made the motion, it is ſaid, <hi>he went after her ſtrait-way:</hi> or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately without any more ado, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And as it argues a heart the more perfectly ſanctified, when it is <hi>ſitted for a very good work, Tit.</hi> 3.1 for any honourable uſe; ſo it argues a heart more exceedingly unclean when it is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be uſed by Satan in any evil work, when the heart is prepared as an Oven fit for any Batch, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.6.
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:115739:247"/> fit to <hi>be led captive at the will of Satan,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26. And the truth is, that makes a man ſtubble to judgement, becauſe he hath been ſtubble to ſin firſt: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore luſt in a mans heart is not only compared to fire amongſt men that muſt be fed with fewel, and ſo it ſooner burns: but it is a fire that feeds it ſelf without fewel, and therefore called the fire of hell, <hi>Iames</hi> 3.6.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the more ſin paſſeth through the whole man without controul, the more unclean the heart is; as in the performance of duty, the more the ſoul is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued to the duty, <hi>and every thought brought into ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.2. the more ſanctified it is: ſo on the contrary, the more the heart is ſubdued by a luſt, and the leſs reſiſtance it finds, <hi>Iude</hi> 11. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                     <hi>v.</hi> So <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.36. <hi>Thy filthyneſs was poured out to all thy Lovers:</hi> when ſhame which is a doom to ſome mens luſts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails not: when checks of conſcience, thoughts of death and Judgement, keep not mens luſts from over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.4. it ſhews a heart exceedingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the more unſatiable mens deſires are in the commiſsion of any ſin, the more unclean the man is: <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.5,6. <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> for his covetouſneſs is compared <hi>to a Drunkard</hi> for his unſatiableneſs; for none cal faſter for wine uſually then they that have had too much before: it is with greedineſs. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.19. <hi>who being paſt feeling have given themſelves over to work all uncleanneſs,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.4. <hi>with greedineſs, exceſs of riot, wherein they think it ſtrange that you run not with them to the ſame exceſs of riot.</hi> Iſa. 5.14. <hi>As the grave, and as hell they weary themſelves, Ierem.</hi> 9.5 the members are weary in obeying, when the Law of the members is
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:115739:248"/> never weary exacting: <hi>Balaams</hi> luſt was too ſwift for the very beaſt, and mens luſts are often too vaſt for their weakned and tyred ability to act them: therefore they <hi>load themſelves with thick clay, Hab.</hi> 2.4,5. enough to load them, but not to ſatisfie them.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, the more proviſion a man makes for luſts before, and the more plots he hath going to accompliſh his luſts, the more unclean that man is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.14. As <hi>Iudas ſought opportunity to betray Chriſt, Mat.</hi> 26.16. And <hi>ſome do provide themſelves of nets and draggs before hand to catch men,</hi> as <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.5. and 6.7. <hi>They have made ready their heart as an Oven:</hi> it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be ſpoken of the Princes of Iſrael under ſome Idolatrous King: the hearts of the Princes and the Counſellers were ready as an Oven: they had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared themſelves to receive and bring in any wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or any Idolatry, and they were ready to bring the people into it, and they had their Agents went about to leaven the people that were not all of that mind: pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, in the mean time it is ſaid, the ſaker, the King ſome ſay, or elſe they that had the ſpecial hand in this, he ſleeps not at night, but he obſerves how the plots take, and where the lump is leavened, and the people prepared to entertain the innovations that he did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to bring in, and if they miſs an opportunity of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning they be ſorry for it, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 5.20.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, and laſtly, The more luſt doth diſturb a man in holy duties: it did ſhew indeed that <hi>Elyes ſons were ſons of</hi> Belial, <hi>that lay with the women at the door of the Tabernacle,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.22. It argued that <hi>Zimry</hi> was deſperately ſet <hi>upon evil, when in a day of humiliation he durſt bring a woman</hi> where all the Congregation were humbling themſelves before the Lord. So for a man
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:115739:248"/> to lead a luſt through the whole ſoul in the ſpecial pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God in his Ordinances, ſhews a very unclean ſpirit; if <hi>the heart of the people go after covetouſneſs when they are hearing, Ezek.</hi> 33.31. and <hi>after vain glory in prayer, Mat.</hi> 6.5. for if ever grace have the advantage, it is then when a man ſtands before the Lord; and that ſin bear it down at beſt duties, it argues that luſt is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding powerful in a man, and he is exceedingly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean.</p>
                  <p>Now for ſome rules to judge of the perfection of this work, how a man comes neerer to it, take theſe five.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The more clearly a man diſcerns, and the more fully his heart is affected with ſpiritual ſins, the more clearly he can diſcern them: for as all ſins proceed from darkneſs ſo every ſin encreaſeth darkneſs: the more unclean any man is, the more blind he is: therefore <hi>Paul</hi> could not only ſee Satans pitched battles againſt him, but <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2 11. <hi>the ſtratagems and ambuſhes</hi> that he uſed: not only the temptation: it ſelf, but Satans plots and purpoſes in tempting: <hi>the depths of Satan, Rev.</hi> 2.24. And the more he is affected with them, the more bitterly he doth condemn them, and mourn for them, as <hi>David</hi> for <hi>his baſe dejection, Pſal.</hi> 42.11. his <hi>carnal confidence in the creature, Pſal.</hi> 30.6,7. <hi>his ſecret grudging at the proſperity of the wicked;</hi> Pſal. 73.21,22. Agur <hi>for his brutiſhneſs,</hi> in regard of ſpiritual things, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.2. <hi>Surely I am more brutiſh then any man, and have not the underſtanding of a man:</hi> Hezekiah <hi>for the pride of his heart,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.26. for as a mans graces grow more and more in the new man inward, in the old man ſo will his luſts and temptations be: and therefore they that be ſtill exerciſed about outward
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:115739:249"/> and bodily luſts, it argues a ſmall cleanſing in them: but the more a man conſiders that <hi>God is a Spirit,</hi> and his eye is moſt upon the Spirits of men, and that theſe defiling luſts before God make him moſt like unto the Devil, who is <hi>ſpiritual wickedneſs,</hi> and he ſaith, My houſe, and land, and eſtate is worth ſo much, <hi>but my heart is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth, Prov.</hi> 10.20. for conſider if it were with me as with <hi>Maximenius</hi> and ſome of thoſe <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours; through their exceeding gluttony their bodies bred vermine continually; how loathſom ſhould it be for you to think, and to have reaſon ſo to do? but <hi>I am a man of a corrupt mind,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.5. and that continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally breeds vermine, and will at laſt <hi>the worm that never dyes;</hi> and this makes a man loath and abhorr himſelf; it is a good ſign of a clean heart.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The more a man hates and is afflicted, and gos mourning for not only the raigning but the being of ſin, as it was with the Apoſtle, that ſin had never rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, that it had never led him captive, yet <hi>his body of death</hi> makes him <hi>miſerable, Rom.</hi> 7.24. the very being of it: when it is with a man in regard of ſin, as it was with le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie the Type, <hi>Lev.</hi> 14.44,45. <hi>When they had ſcrapt about it, and carried out the duſt, then they ſhall ſweep it again; then if it break forth again the houſe muſt be pluckt down:</hi> So when a man hath done all he can by remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the duſt, and by carrying out the rubbiſh, and yet luſt will ſpread, then to be contented, and deſire to have the houſe diſſolved, the houſe of nature, that the building of ſin might be deſtroyed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2. it is an Argument of a great meaſure of puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The more ſpeedily a mans heart is awakned to turn to God after ſinning: it was a ſign that <hi>Davids</hi>
                     <pb n="439" facs="tcp:115739:249"/> heart was in a clean frame, when his <hi>heart ſmote him,</hi> aſſoon as he had <hi>cut off the lap of</hi> Sauls <hi>garment,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.5,6. and of <hi>Peter</hi> that <hi>immediately he went out and wept bitterly, Math.</hi> 26. <hi>ult.</hi> The firſt note was, that a pure heart keeps it ſelf, <hi>that the wicked one toucheth him not:</hi> but the ſecond is ſpeedily to return and cleanſe a mans ſelf after falling: <hi>Davids</hi> heart was in a defiled frame, that he could lie well nigh a year in the ſins of Adultery and Murder, without repentance: <hi>the heart of a man is a fountain, Mat.</hi> 12.35. that preſerves it ſelf pure and in its firſt glory as a fountain doth; but if mudd do at any time enter into it, it will be continually work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it out: and it is as truly an argument of purity as the other: and when a man repents, that will alſo afflict him, that God was forced to uſe ſo many means with him before he could be brought to repentance; that <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim</hi> bemoans, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.18.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The more jealous a man is of himſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every occaſion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.22. How far am I guilty in this ſin? <hi>Is it I Lord?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, The leſs a mans heart is affected, and the leſs he is taken with worldly things, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.1. <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Hem Germana illa Beſtia:</hi> and as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> prefer the good of the people of God before any world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advantage of their own.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, The more truly glad a man is, and can bleſs the Lord that he hath been pleaſed to croſs him in a way of ſinning; let God croſs <hi>Ahab</hi> and he is in a rage; <hi>better meet a Beare robbed of her whelps,</hi> then meet a wicked man God hath croſſed in a way of ſinning, <hi>Pro.</hi> 17.12. croſs <hi>David</hi> in a way of ſinning, and he bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Lord. <hi>And</hi> David <hi>ſaid to</hi> Abigail, <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael which ſent thee this day to meet me;
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:115739:250"/> and bleſſed be thy advice, and bleſſed be thou which haſt kept me this day from coming to ſhed blood, and from avenging myſelf with my own hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Motives thereunto are theſe five.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, this fits a man for communion with the Lord, and makes his communion more clear; for <hi>what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion hath light with darkneſs, Chriſt with</hi> Belial? and though a man be godly, and ſo hath <hi>fellowſhip with the Father, and with his ſon Chriſt,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.6 <hi>yet if we ſay we have fellowſhip with him, and walk in darkneſs, we lye:</hi> if therefore walking in darkneſs take away all fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, then the more a man walks in darkneſs, the leſs fellowſhip he hath; therefore the promiſe to a clear com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, is unto ſuch as <hi>ſeparate themſelves;</hi> for <hi>then God ſaith, I will receive you,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <hi>I will dwell in you,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16,17. which notes clear and neer communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is a ſpecial means to be imployed, that God ſhould uſe a man, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.21. <hi>If a man therefore purge himſelf from theſe, he ſhall be a veſſel to honour, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>tified and meet for the Maſters uſe,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.3. and Godly men be as happy in their ſervices as in their rewards: on the contrary, it is a Judgement to be deſpiſed of God, ſo as not to be uſed; a veſſel where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he takes no pleaſure, <hi>Ier.</hi> 22.28. <hi>The earthen veſſels leprous muſt be broken,</hi> they are of no uſe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this will make a man ready and willing to do ſervice; for it is corruption that is the clog that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from ſervice, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Let us lay aſide every weight, and the ſin which doth ſo eaſily beſet us. Iſa.</hi> 6.6. and 7.8. when the Lord ſaith, <hi>Whom ſhall I ſend?</hi> the Prophet ſaith, <hi>ſend me: non tardat uncta rota;</hi> but ſee the contrary in <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Ionah;</hi> and this makes men in all
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:115739:250"/> the duties God cals them unto, no longer then cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption is bribed, to drive heavily.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, This makes all our ſervices the more ſweet unto God, the more clean the heart is in them, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.4. <hi>Then ſhall the offerings of</hi> Judah <hi>and</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>be pleaſant unto the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> Pſal. 66.18. <hi>But if I regard iniquity in my heart, God will not hear me;</hi> the duty would be more valuable in Gods account. <hi>Luke</hi> 21.3. <hi>The poor widdow caſt in more then they all;</hi> becauſe her mite came from a purer ſpirit then their great gifts: therefore ſuch ſervices of the Saints, Chriſt cals them <hi>the honey and the honey-combe, wine and milk:</hi> to ſhew how accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they are, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.1.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, conſider the glorious motives and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements we have therein; as Firſt the promiſes, <hi>Ezek,</hi> 47.8. and <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.2. Secondly, the Spirit of Chriſt to be a <hi>ſpirit of burning, Iſa.</hi> 4.4. and when the Church is in the pureſt condition, yet alwaies this ſpirit is lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her on to perfection ſtill; <hi>the ſpirit and the Bride ſaith come, Rev.</hi> 22.17. and Chriſt and the Father love the purity as well as the proſperity of his people: and if we would ſet faith on work, he hath promiſed to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt it, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.20,21. <hi>In that day ye all know that I am in my Father:</hi> in his counſel, in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="442" facs="tcp:115739:251"/> to purifie you: by my wiſdom to guide you: and by my power to keep you; and by my glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Crown you: <hi>You unto whom</hi> I will ſay, <hi>Enter into the joy of your Lord:</hi> theſe are the better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the Goſpel; and it is the lowneſs of mens ſpirits, want of Chriſtian greatneſs of mind, ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the conſideration of this, that is the true cauſe why Chriſtians lie fettered with their old failings, and out-grow their infirmities no more then they do.</p>

               <p>Secondly, there are not only Congregational and Perſonal ſins, and mercies, but there are National alſo; and there are times when God cals a people to be humbled for the one, and to be thankful for the other: and in both theſe, the Miniſters of the Goſpel muſt be employed as Trumpeters to ſound forth the praiſe of God, and as watch-men to give warning of Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, and of the time and approach of Judgement.</p>

                     <label>Doctrine.</label> There is unto a ſinful Nation a ſet and an appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed time for Iudgement: a time when Iudgement ſhall infallibly come, and God will bear with them no longer: God being the antient of dayes, he is the Lord of time, and the great Land-lord of the world, and he hath ſet unto every thing a ſeaſon, or an appointed time <hi>to every thing under Heaven, Eccl.</hi> 3 1. but in reference to the point in hand, it will be requiſite that we conſider of a ſix-fold time appointed by him that is Lord of time.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, there is a time of ſinning, a ſet and an appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed time; for there is, Firſt a fulneſs of ſin, appointed by God that it ſhall have its period, it ſhall not grow <hi>in infinitum,</hi> Gen. 15.16 <hi>The iniquity of the</hi> Amorites <hi>is not yet full:</hi> and as there was a fulneſs, ſo there is a time appointed to fill up this meaſure, <hi>to fill the Ephah, Zach.</hi> 5.6. where the meaſure of the ſin of the people of Iſrael is ſet out for the greatneſs of it by an <hi>Ephah,</hi> the greateſt dry meaſure amongſt the Iews: and there was a time for the filling up of the <hi>Ephah,</hi> before it was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into the Land of <hi>Shinar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, there is a meaſure of wrath which every veſſel of wrath ſhall treaſure up (for all ſhall not have the ſame meaſure) and the Reaſon is, becauſe all do not treaſure up the ſame meaſure unto themſelves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4,5. Now ſeeing it is a Treaſure that doth grow by degrees and ſeveral additions, there muſt be a time for the filling and the gathering of this Treaſure; ſome
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:115739:255"/> Exchequer daies when this Treaſure is brought in; ſo that the time in which men fill up the meaſures of ſin, and the treaſure of wrath, this is that which I call an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time of ſinning.</p>
                  <p>Now as ſome men, and ſome Nations meaſures and treaſures are greater then others, ſo God gives them an appointed time to fill it up; and being conſidered in it ſelf, the greateſt Iudgement that can befall a man is for the Lord to give unto a man or a Nation a long time of ſinning: as the time that man hath to ſin is but ſmall, only during the time of the body, for he ſhall only give an account of the <hi>things done in the body,</hi> not thoſe that are done <hi>in ſtatu ſeparato,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. and to a man in the body, <hi>there is an appointed time under heaven, Iob.</hi> 7.1. a ſhort time appointed for his being, and therefore a ſhort time for his ſinning. But the Devil hath a large time, from the beginning of the world, unto the end of it, to the day of Iudgement, which argues that there is much wrath reſerved and prepared for him, that muſt have ſo long time to enlarge the veſſel, and fit it to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it; for as gray hairs are a Crown if they be found in the way of righteouſneſs, <hi>Pro.</hi> 16.31. that is, it is a ſpecial mercy to live long to add to a mans Crown. ſo it is a ſpecial curſe for a man to go on in evil, and yet his daies to be prolonged, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 8.12.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, a time of patience, when the Lord holds his peace and reproves not, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.21. indeed <hi>God is angry with the wicked every morning, Pſal.</hi> 7.11. there is not a day that he riſeth, but a cloud of Gods diſpleaſure riſeth over him, but yet he deferrs his Iudgement, holds his hand; there is a time, when <hi>he is preſt under their abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations as a Cart is preſt under ſheavs, Amos</hi> 2.13. for to have men go on to ſin againſt him, and becauſe <hi>Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:115739:255"/> is not executed ſpeedily,</hi> therefore to have <hi>their hearts fully ſet in them to do evil,</hi> and the patience of God to be made the ground and the encouragement of ſinning, cannot be but a great and a heavy burthen to the patience of God; and yet there is a time when the Lord bears, and doth not by and by <hi>eaſe himſelf of his adverſaries,</hi> as he ſaith in Iudgement he doth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.24. and it is an eaſe to him, <hi>Ier.</hi> 32.31. <hi>the City of Ieruſalem,</hi> the Lord ſaith, <hi>had been a provocation to him from the day that it was built,</hi> which was many hundred years, and yet the Lord had born it, and had not removed it out of his ſight according as he threatned for to do; for there is a ſeaſon for God to glorifie all his attributes; he will make them all exceeding glorious in their time; now after this life there ſhall be time to glorifie Iuſtice, Mercy and Truth; but the patience of God can have no place in heaven, nothing that ſhall burthen Gods patience: and in hell he will ſhew forth no patience: nothing but <hi>wrath to the veſſels of wrath:</hi> it is <hi>the breath, the fury of the Lord that is a River of Brimſtone burning in it,</hi>

                     <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. <hi>ult.</hi> therefore there muſt be a time for the Lord to glorifie his patience, and a time for Chriſt <hi>to rule in the midſt of his enemies;</hi> and a time for him to <hi>rule over them, when they ſhall be made his foot-ſtool:</hi> there muſt be a time for the <hi>decree</hi> to conceive and to bear before it <hi>bring forth, Zeph.</hi> 2.1. The truth is, we conſider not what a precious time even the time of patience is; to have a poor ſoul that expects to be executed at laſt, but to have two or three years added to his life by way of a reprival, how great a favour doth he eſteem it? So for a man or a people to have deſerved death, for the Lord to cut ten or twenty years out of eternity, but to reſpit the Iudgement, and give a man
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:115739:256"/> but ſo much time of eaſe, it is a ſpecial and extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry favour. It is not time of ſlackneſs, but time of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, there is a time of repentance, when God doth defer and reſpit the Iudgement after ſinning, of purpoſe that man may return and come in, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.21. <hi>I gave her ſpace to repent, and ſhe repented not:</hi> the words are Emphatical, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; he gave it, and the principal and proper intent that God had in it, was this, that they might have time to repent, come in and make their peace in a time wherein the Lord calls men to repentance, by the miniſtery of the word, <hi>ſtretching out his hands all the day long, Ier.</hi> 32.33. when the <hi>Lord calls to weeping, mourning, baldneſs and ſack-cloath, Iſa.</hi> 22.7. a time when the Lord ſtrives inwardly with the ſpirit of a man, to bring him to a ſight of ſins and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for them: a time when, <hi>if men ſeek him he will be found, Iſa.</hi> 55.6. and when though the Lord do threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten never ſo ſeverely, it is but with condition of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and if then they will come forth and take hold of his ſtrength, and make peace with him, they ſhall make peace according to his promiſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27 5. when though there be a cloud of blood hang over a people, and grievouſly threaten danger, but yet it is but conditional, and if they return and repent they ſhall make their peace and God will be again reconciled, and the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall not come, as we ſee in <hi>Nineveh:</hi> for that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I call time of repentance, when there is hope of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; elſe repentance will not profit; for it comes too late.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the time of patience and repentance have their periods; indeed theſe times are not of the ſame length to all: to ſome God ſhew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> but a little patience, and to others a great deal, riches of patience,
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:115739:256"/> and forbearance, that though they do evil a hundred times, yet their daies are prolonged: ſo for repentance, ſome have but a winters, and others a ſummers day: but when theſe are longeſt, yet there is a time when they will expire, and <hi>time ſhall be no more:</hi> they have their fixed and ſet bounds, that they cannot paſs.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, time of repentance; for though the <hi>ſpirit</hi> may ſtrive and ſtrive long, yet he ſaith, he <hi>ſhall not alwaies ſtrive, Gen.</hi> 6.3. and though if in the day of repentance men do come in, <hi>he will turn from his fierce wrath, Iſa.</hi> 55.6. Yet if this time be paſt there is a time when the Lord will not be found. <hi>Ieruſalem had the day of her vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation,</hi> wherein ſhe might have known <hi>the things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to her peace;</hi> but a great while before the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment came, <hi>they were hid from her eyes,</hi> Luke 19.42.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is true, the time of patience may laſt longer then the time of repentance: for God may with-hold his hand, even when Judgement is determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt a people, but yet the time of patience will not alwaies laſt; the longeſt day hath its evening: there is indeed a long time ſometimes <hi>of whetting the ſword, and bending the bow, and making it ready, Pſal.</hi> 7.12,3. But there will be a time of ſmiting alſo; no ſouldier doth alwaies whet his ſword, but becauſe he hath a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to cut at laſt; though the decree bear long in its womb yet it will not bear alwaies: there is a time when it <hi>will bring forth, Zeph.</hi> 2.1. ſo that the time of patience hath its period.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, when the time of patience is expired, there is then a time for Iudgement, <hi>a day of recompence, a year of vengeance,</hi> a time for the expending of thoſe <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of wrath</hi> that have been ſo long laying in; becauſe
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:115739:257"/> there was by ſinning a time of treaſuring: and ſo there ſhall alſo come a time of ſpending, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4,5. a time for the wall that is ſwelled out to hang, but there will come a time alſo when it will fall, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.13. husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men expect with much patience the ripening of the grapes; there is a time of ripening, and there is a time of <hi>preſsing and treading the winepreſs, Rev.</hi> 14.10. The Butcher ſtayes till the cattle be fat; there is a fatting-time, and there is a killing time: and then they ſhall be plucked out as ſheep for the ſlaughter, <hi>Ier.</hi> 12.3.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, when this time doth come, the Lord will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear a people no longer: this determinating of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the time of it is exceedingly ſet before us in the word, and that under divers expreſſions.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Lord doth expreſs it by a full and a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory reſolution that he will do it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 21.27. <hi>I will over-turn, over-turn, over-turn, and it ſhall be no more, I the Lord have ſpoken it,</hi> Chap. 24.14. <hi>It ſhall come to paſs, I will do it, I will not go back, neither will I ſpare, neither will I repent, but according to thy waies and according to thy doings ſhall they judge thee, ſaith the Lord God;</hi> they are the expreſſions of a great, and a full, and peremptory reſolution that will not be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is called a <hi>decree,</hi> or the <hi>bringing forth the decree, Zeph.</hi> 2.2. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>ſcripſit:</hi> and ſo it is commonly uſed in the Scripture, and ſo I conceive it to be underſtood, <hi>non de occulto conſilio, ſed de decreto promulgato.</hi> Its true in that the word of God by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of the Prophets, there were many threatnings and judgements denounced, but <hi>faetus adhuc in utero latet:</hi> there is a time when all theſe threatnings will
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:115739:257"/> take place, for they ſhall not be in vain, there is not a word that goes forth, but it <hi>ſhall accompliſh the thing that I ſpeak, Iſa.</hi> 55.11.</p>
                  <p>Now it is called a decree in a double reſpect.</p>
                  <p>Firſt decrees are acts of authority.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they are eſtabliſhed and firm, they ſhall not be altered or diſannulled; therefore every judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a decree, and though it may be long hid, that a man doth not know what is in the womb of it, yet there will come a time for the Decree of God to be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and then there is no hope: men ſhall be as chaff, and paſs away in that day.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is called <hi>ſwearing in his wrath, Pſal.</hi> 9.11. It is true that the word of God is as firm and ſure as his oath; <hi>for Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs away, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then one jot of it ſhall paſs away:</hi> but yet in the word there may be, and commonly is, an implicit and a tacit condition; as we ſee, <hi>Ier.</hi> 18.18. <hi>If I ſpeak concerning a a Nation or a Kingdom, to pluck it up and deſtroy it, if that Nation turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them:</hi> but the oath of God ſhuts out all ſecret and tacit conditions whatſoever, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhall ariſe <hi>de novo,</hi> that ſhall hinder the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment thereof; which muſt not be conceived, as if it were peculiar unto that time, or unto this people, but that the Lord doth conſtantly the ſame againſt other people, and in other times alſo, as the Apoſtle plainly manifeſts to us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.11,12.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, thoſe means that do uſually prevail with God, and turn away Iudgement when it is threatned, In the time of Iudgement they prevail nothing with the Lord: and they are theſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, repentance comes too late; ſo much the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:115739:258"/> doth intimate, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.1,2. <hi>gather your ſelves,</hi> that is, by repentance and publike humiliation, but what is the ſeaſon? it muſt be <hi>before the decree come forth</hi> imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing otherwiſe it would not avail; many there were no doubt in <hi>Iudah,</hi> that were <hi>the Basket of good figs,</hi> that did repent and humble themſelves but yet it came too late to keep off the Iudgement, they muſt be carried into captivity as well as the bad: indeed repentance never comes too late, if it be true, to prevent the curſe: but many times it may come too late to keep off the croſs</p>
                  <p>Secondly, but if that to their repentance they add prayers, will not the Lord hear them? <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.28. <hi>they ſhall call, but I will not anſwer: for there is a time when that the Lord will not be found, Iſa.</hi> 55.6.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, but what if to their prayers they add faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, will not the Lord hear them then? No, <hi>Ier.</hi> 14.12. <hi>When they faſt I will not hear their cry, but I will conſume them by the ſword, by the famine, and by the peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, but if God will not do it for their own ſakes, yet it may be he may for ſome other godly mans ſake, if the godly pray for them; they may <hi>ſtand in the gap,</hi> as we know <hi>Moſes</hi> did, and did hinder the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of Iudgement upon the people: No, then the Lord will not hear them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.16. <hi>Pray not for this people, neither lift up a cry or a prayer for them, for I will not hear thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, but yet if he will not hear one of the Saints apart, yet the united prayers of the godly may prevail far with him, and that may overcome; but the Lord names the moſt powerful men with God that ever were, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.14. <hi>Noah, Daniel, Job,</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                     <pb n="457" facs="tcp:115739:258"/> and <hi>Samuel, Jer.</hi> 15.1. and yet the Lord ſaith, if they did ſtand before him (an expreſſion of prayer and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion) yet his mind could not be towards that people.</p>
                  <p>There is therefore a ſet and appointed time for judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and if that be once come, the Lord will forbear a people no longer; it will be eaſier to weigh the fire, to meaſure the winds, to recall the day that is paſt, to change the Ordinances of heaven, and to reſtore the verdure of the withered graſs, then to reverſe the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and Decree gone forth againſt a ſinful Nation; for as <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid to <hi>Saul, he is not a man that he ſhould repent.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>This time of Judgement may and muſt be known:</hi> for why are they blamed if they might not? and how juſtly could they be blamed if they ought not to have known it? <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.3. It is that Chriſt reproves in the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, <hi>they could diſcern the true face of the sky, but could not diſcern the ſigns of the times:</hi> one might have been done as wel as the other, if they had applyed themſelves to the like care and induſtry.</p>
                  <p>But may it be known? as the Lord governs the world by the Sun, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.18. and in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth many times cauſe Comets and blazing Stars as tokens of ſome dangerous and diſmal accidents ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching in nature: ſo hath the Lord ſet forth by the Book of the Word, ſome ſigns alſo hat are as ſo many Comets to the world, if a man doth wiſely behold them by a ſpiritual eye and a right judgement reſulting from them: for the waies of God are unchangable; he is not wearied with proceſs of time, neither can he be
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:115739:259"/> ever won to give his bleſſing in one age, which he hath curſed in another: and therefore that which hath been a ſign of Iudgement in one age, muſt needs be ſo in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for the word of God is like to a well-drawn pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, that caſts an eye upon every perſon and every Nation alike. It is neceſſary therefore to enquire what be the ſigns foregoing Iudgement, which the Scripture doth ſet down.</p>
                  <p>I will only mention theſe two, which I deſire every one that is wiſe will lay to heart, that ſo he may be able a little to diſcern the ſigns of the times.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, a fulneſs of ſin: that is made the ſign when Iudgement was to come upon the <hi>Amorites, Gen.</hi> 15.16. <hi>when their iniquity was full:</hi> and this is made the ground of bringing Iudgement, <hi>put in thy ſikle and reap, for the harveſt is ripe, Ioel</hi> 3.16. So <hi>Jer.</hi> 1.11,12. An Almond tree hath the firſt ripe fruit of any tree, and it notes the haſtening of them to ripen their ſins; and the Lord ſaith, as they did haſten their ſins to a ripeneſs, ſo he would haſten to ripen his Iudgements, ſo that this is a certain ſign foregoing Iudgement: But when is ſin full? when is it ripe in a Nation? I know Divines commonly and truly ſet forth the fulneſs of ſin by its univerſality, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudency and obſtinacy, but I will not inſiſt upon theſe.</p>
                  <p>But let us look into this Nation of <hi>Iudah,</hi> of which our Prophet ſpeaks here, and ſee what did ripen their ſins, and brought them to that fulneſs that brought the Iudgement: ſee what it was amongſt them that filled the <hi>Epha,</hi> and made way for <hi>the women with the wind in their wings to carry them away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, when a people ſeeks to make void the Law: then <hi>it is time for God to work:</hi> that is, to execute Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:115739:259"/> ſo <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.126. the word in the original is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> which ſignifies <hi>irritum facere, non palam ex profeſſo, ſed oblique:</hi> not by open oppoſing, but by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret undermining; it is fitly expreſt by our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.6. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>ye have unlorded,</hi> taken away the ruling power of <hi>the Law by your Traditions;</hi> how this hath been done in this Nation, in theſe latter times, is not unknown unto them that know any thing of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of this Church; ſometimes by oppoſing Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to Scripture, ſometimes by ſubtile diſtinctions, grounded upon Scriptures in a ſhow, by miſinterpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and frigid expoſitions put upon Scripture, by falſe concluſions and <hi>Paralogiſmes</hi> drawn out of Scripture, and by cuſtoms and Church traditions put upon it as the practiſe of the Primitive Church, the Iudgement of the learned; and all that the wiſdom of men, and not the Law of God might rule; but when men come ſo far that they dare not only to change the Laws of men, but to temper with, and un-lord the Law of God, it is time for the people of God to pray, and then it is time for God to work.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, corrupting the worſhip of God by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane inventions, that have a ſhow of wiſdom, and will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip to hold correſpondency with Idolaters, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.33. <hi>Why trimeſt thou thy way to ſeek love?</hi> he ſpeaks it of their correſpondence with Idolaters: ſometimes with <hi>Egypt,</hi> and ſometimes with <hi>Aſſyria<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> they did ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der things in Gods worſhip as might beſt further their Politick ends; now this triming did pleaſe, and then another, and all was to pleaſe their Lovers. How much triming hath been uſed in this Nation of late years? we muſt have Altars, Crucifixes, Copes, Tapers, Baſons: ſometimes we have been taken with the <hi>French,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:115739:260"/> the <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> and ſometime the <hi>Italian</hi> faſhion; what is this but to trim our way to ſeek love?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Confederacy with Idolaters of a contrary Religion. <hi>Ier.</hi> 2.36. <hi>why gaddeſt thou about to change thy way?</hi> ſometimes they went down to <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſometimes they did ſlie to <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> &amp;c. this is called <hi>the fornication of the Nations Ezek.</hi> 16. The gadding of this Nation of latter times in this kind, I need not ſpeak of that; it is too well known unto moſt Nations in the Chriſtian world; but all that ever we are like to get by it is the ſame that was the gain of this people; <hi>Ahaz</hi> made a confederacy with the King of <hi>Aſſyria.</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.20. and he came and diſtreſſed him, but ſtrengthened him not.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, abuſing the Meſſengers of God, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.16. <hi>They mocked his Meſſengers, and they miſ uſed his Prophets, till the wrath of God roſe up againſt them that there was no remedy.</hi> How far this hath taken place in theſe latter daies is not unknown to all; many of them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, diſgraced, deprived: and thoſe that did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy their liberty for the moſt part <hi>Prophecied in Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth, Rev.</hi> 11. in much affliction and full of doubts and fears, every one ſuſpecting whether what he did would pleaſe or no.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, not laying to heart the afflictions of our Brethren, <hi>Amos</hi> 6.6.7. <hi>They drink wine in bowls, and ſtretch themſelves upon beds of Ivory; therefore they ſhall go into Captivity with the firſt that go Captive:</hi> how far we have been affected with the diſtreſſes of our brethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren in <hi>France</hi> formerly, the deſolations in <hi>Germany,</hi> and the preſent unheard of cruelties in <hi>Ireland,</hi> our hearts know very well, and it will be well if in <hi>the day when the Lord makes in juiſition for blood,</hi> ſome of this
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:115739:260"/> blood be not found bound up in our own skirts.</p>
                  <p>Theſe were the evils that ripened the harveſt of ſin with them, and moved the Lord to ſay unto the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner of Judgement, <hi>put in thy ſickle and reap, oel</hi> 3.13. and how can we expect but that it ſhall be ſo with us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo? for God meaſures all Nations with the ſame line, and the ſame plumet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.17.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the beginnings of Iudgement are an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent token that the time of Iudgement draws neer: <hi>When the Fig-tree puts forth leaves you ſay ſummer is neer; ſo when you ſe theſe things come to paſs ſay it is neer, even at the door. Lu</hi> 2.30 3 For he ſaith in Judgement, <hi>when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, I wil alſo make an end,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.12 as former mercies be pledges of future and meat for the ſoul to feed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the expectation of mercy; <hi>he gave them to be meat to his people in the wilderneſs, Pſal</hi> 74.14. ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Judgements are meat alſo for the ſoul to feed upon in the expectation of future; for the wrath of God breaking in upon a people, is like a breach in awall where the enemy will be ſure with all violence to break in if no man <hi>ſtand in the gap</hi> to make reſiſtance: <hi>impoſsibile a patente porta iram Dei non procedere.</hi> For by a leſſer Judgement God makes way for his anger, for a perfect and an utter ruine, <hi>Pſaul.</hi> 78.50.</p>
                  <p>Let us ſee whether the ſame way be not made with us as it was with them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, all Nations about them were againſt them, <hi>Ier.</hi> 12.9. <hi>Mine inherit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nce is as a ſpeckled Bird;</hi> the Birds round about her are againſt her as a ſtrange Bird ſeldom ſeen: the Birds uſually fall upon and ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt her; &amp; if we did wiſely conſider the eſtate of this Kingdom how it is a ſpeckled bird, and how the
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:115739:261"/> Nations about her are againſt her as a ſtrange bird, it were eaſy to conceive, and what expectations moſt of them have from the preſent ſtate of things amongſt us it is not hard to gueſs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the general corruption and decay of truth and wiſdom of men in places of greateſt truſt: <hi>their ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver becomes droſs, and their wine mixed with water, Iſa.</hi> 1.22. their Judges and Officers, and men in authority, growing daily more and more corrupt: <hi>the beſt of them is a Briar, Mich.</hi> 7.4. that is, a poor man flies to them for ſhelter as a ſheep to a thorny hedge, and inſtead of defending, they do fleece him in; and what follows? <hi>the day of thy watchmen, and thy viſitation cometh;</hi> now ſhall be their perplexity; what hath been the condition of this ſtate we all know; how <hi>ſervants have ruled over us, and there was none to deliver us out of their hands:</hi> men of ſervile birth and education, and ſervile ſpirits, in ſo much that there hath been no peace either to him that went out, or to him that came in; for God did vex us with all adverſity, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.6.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the ſubverſion of fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, which the Scripture calls the <hi>foundation</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which a Kindom ſtands: which was a bitter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the Church of God in this ſtate; <hi>all the foundations of the earth were out of courſe, Pſal.</hi> 82.5. what invaſions have been made upon us, and our Laws, hath been abundantly of late diſcovered: and <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>that he that breaks a hedge, a Serpent ſhall bite him, Eccl.</hi> 10.8. he ſpeaks it of this hedge by which a people are defended, and kept ſeveral, that all do not become firſt a Common, and then a Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, private and inteſtine diviſions amongſt us,
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:115739:261"/> the fore-running of Gods laſt and fierceſt wrath upon that people, <hi>Ephraim againſt Manaſſch, and both againſt Iudah, Iſa.</hi> 9. ult which the Lord ſaith is as if one member in the ſame body ſhould be injurious to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as if a man ſhould <hi>eate the fleſh of his own arm;</hi> and how far the wrath of God is at preſent ſtretched forth againſt this Nation, we all know and complain of; what ſecret whiſperings and murmurings, what jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and fears there are one of another, and what par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and how <hi>for theſe diviſions there do ariſe great thoughts of heart,</hi> we can never ſufficiently bewail, which doth continnally threaten that the Lord will take us and daſh us one againſt another as <hi>Potters</hi> Veſſels.</p>
                  <p>Theſe were the fore-runners of Judgement with this Nation, which did ſhow them that the time of Judgement was at hand: and theſe are now the ſins of the times, which may juſtly occaſion us to conceive that the time of Judgement is at hand; let it not be our ſin which is here reproved as theirs, that we ſhould not know the time of the Judgement of the Lord.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, that you may know the time to improve this promiſe. <hi>Whoſoever keepeth the Commandment ſhall find no evil; a wiſe mans heart ſhall diſcern time and Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> Eccl. 8 5.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>a wiſe man foreſees the evil, and hides
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:115739:262"/> himſelf; but fools paſs on, and are puniſhed,</hi> Prov. 22.3.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>by a work</hi> of humiliation; <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.16. <hi>When I heard, my belly trembled; rottenneſs entred into my bones, I trembled in my ſelf, that I might reſt in the evil day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, a work of reformation, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Seek righteouſneſs, ſeek meekneſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, improve all the promiſes, that perfection to which you are called, <hi>Iſa</hi> 26 <hi>ult come my people, enter into your chambers:</hi> the Promiſes and Attributes are the chambers of the godly; but you muſt come into them, elſe they will afford no ſhelter: upon all the glory ſhall be a defence.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, be much in prayer; to lay in for this time, will be profitable for you; for know, prayer never proves ineffectual to a ſpiritual end: it never in this reſpect comes too late, becauſe God never comes too late. 1 <hi>King,</hi> 18.45. <hi>Luke</hi> 21.36. <hi>Watch therefore and pray continually, that you may be accounted worthy to eſcape all thoſe things that ſhall come to paſs: fidelibus orationibus Deum ambimus, coelum tundimus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, betake thy ſelf to the mediation of Chriſt, <hi>Mich.</hi> 5.5. for <hi>this man ſhall be the peace when the enemy comes into the Land: he is a refuge from the ſtorm, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence from the wind, a river of water in a dry place: and the ſhaddow of a great Rock in a weary Land, Iſa.</hi> 52.2. therefore <hi>return you to your ſtrong holds, you pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners of hope, Zach.</hi> 9.12. Remember his name is <hi>Shilo</hi> the peace-maker, and he is ſo called everywhere; <hi>when the Scepter departs from</hi> Judah, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.9. there muſt needs be nothing but trouble: yet then he is the peace-maker, then <hi>doth Shilo come.</hi>
